 To understand the point in life we must first understand what it is to be human. It seems to me that the common agent that binds us all together is loss, and so the point in life must be measured in relation to that loss. Our individual losses can be small or large. They can be accumulations of losses barely registered on a singular level, or full-scale cataclysms. Loss is absorbed into our bodies from the moment we are cast from the womb until we end our days, subsumed by it to become the essence of loss itself. We ultimately become the grief of the world, having collected countless losses through our lifetime. These losses are many-faceted and chronic, both monstrous and trivial. They are losses of dignity, losses of agency, losses of trust, losses of spirit, losses of direction or faith, and, of course, losses of the ones we love. They are daily, convulsive disappointments or great historical injuries that cast their shadows across the human predicament, reminding us of the stunning potential of our own loss of humanity. We are capable of the greatest atrocities and the deepest sufferings, all culminating in a vast, collective grief. This is our shared condition.

 Yet happiness and joy continue to burst through this mutual condition. Life, it seems, is full of an insistent, systemic and irrepressible beauty. But these moments of happiness are not experienced alone, rather they are almost entirely relational and are dependent on a connection to the Other – be it people, or nature, or art, or God. This is where meaning establishes itself, within the connectedness, nested in our shared suffering.

 I believe we are meaning-seeking creatures, and these feelings of meaning, relational and connective, are almost always located within kindness. Kindness is the force that draws us together, and this, Beau, is what I think I am trying to say – that despite our collective state of loss, and our potential for evil, there exists a great network of goodness, knitted together by countless everyday human kindnesses.

 These often small, seemingly inconsequential acts of kindness, that Soviet writer Vasily Grossman calls ‘petty, thoughtless kindness’, or ‘unwitnessed kindness’ bind together to create a subterranean and vanquishing Good that counterbalances the forces of evil and prevents suffering from overwhelming the world. We reach out and find each other in the common darkness. By doing so we triumph over our collective and personal loss. Through kindness we slant, shockingly and miraculously, toward meaning. We discover, in that smallest gesture of goodwill laid at the feet of our mutual and monumental loss, ‘the point‘.

Your last Issue (#202) was very beautiful and moving. I think such complete opening of one’s soul must be emotionally exhausting. It would be comprehensible if you needed a pause from writing after a letter like that. I also keep seeing great footage of your tour on social media, and it is incredible how you keep giving your maximum, date after date. That must be very exhausting too, given that you’ve been on tour for a long time now. So my question for you today is simply: How are you?","Dear Natasha,

 I’m fine, I think, as far as zombies go. I’ve been on tour for three months and although I read all the questions that come in, I just can’t get it together to write a response. A Red Hand File requires not so much an emotional resilience as a certain amount of energy and the capacity to think. Long tours with constant travel rob you of these things, I’m afraid. In short, Natasha, I’m fucked. Happily, this has not affected the shows, which have been such a pure and uncomplicated joy!

 I’m taking a holiday in a few weeks, once the tour has finished, and I’ll write to you all then. Thank you for your concern and your very kind words, and please bear with me.

202,July 2022,https://www.theredhandfiles.com/my-favourite-lyrics,my-favourite-lyrics,1,JEREMY,BURLINGTON,USA,"My favourite lyrics from your album Ghosteen are on the final track: “The kid drops his bucket and spade / And climbs into the sun.” I find this so deeply powerful and evocative, although I really can’t say exactly what it means, and I suspect that if I did have an easy and concrete explanation then it would lose much of its power. But of course, the line between profoundly ineffable and nonsensical can be a fine one. My question is, what is your creative process for coming up with these lyrics that may not have an obvious meaning but are nonetheless trying to say something important?","Dear Jeremy,

 I find that many of my favourite lyrics are those that I do not fully understand. They seem to exist in a world of their own – in a place of potentiality, adjacent to meaning. The words feel authentic or true, but remain mysterious, as if a greater truth lies just beyond our understanding. I see this, not just within a song, but within life itself, where awe and wonder live in the tension between what we understand and what we do not understand.

 Sometimes, I write words that seem to vibrate with potential, even though I may not understand their exact meaning. That vibration is a promise. It promises that, in time, all will be revealed. I have learned to trust that intuition, because I know I am dealing with a metaphoric form that is essentially mystifying, and that a seemingly insignificant couple of lines have the capacity to reveal, in their smallness, in time, all of the world.

 ‘The kid drops his bucket and spade/ And climbs into the sun’ are such words. Two short lines that draw to an abrupt and brutal halt the main body of the epic song, ‘Hollywood’. I can understand why these are your favourite lyrics. They are a lovely image. However, looking at them now, these lines are perhaps not so obscure, and without wanting to take away their power by attaching my own meaning to them, their intent seems fairly clear. They mean, the child stopped what he was doing and died.

 ‘The child stopped what he was doing and died’ is also a beautiful line, perhaps a better line, but sometimes some truths are too severe to live on the page, or in a song, or in a heart. Hence, metaphor can create a merciful sense of distance from the cruel idea, or the unspeakable truth, and allow it to exist within us as a kind of poetic radiance, as a work of art.

 Jeremy, I love that those words resonate with you. It is as much as a songwriter can hope for, that the words he or she writes are received, with love, into the heart of others. Thank you for that.

Next Question

What would you say is the major difference between you and Susie?","Dear Maisie and Sharon,

 At the moment, the defining difference between Susie and me is that she watches Love Island, and I don’t. Susie watches Love Island because we know one of the contestants, Luca. Luca was a school friend of our twins, Arthur and Earl. As a consequence, Susie and I became friends with Luca’s parents, Maria and Michael. Maria is an antique dealer. Michael is a fishmonger. Luca is a fishmonger too.

 After Arthur died, in the early days of that terrible, chaotic first week, Maria turned up on our doorstep with a tray of lasagne and basically looked after us. She barely said anything to us. She made us cups of tea. She cooked for us. She was just there. She was the one constant through a time of horror and confusion, when scores of despairing and commiserating people came and went. We will never forget her kindness. Even in the first week, when the world seemed suddenly and shockingly defined by an unspeakable and distorting cruelty, Maria reminded us that there was good in the world. She also served as a lesson in how to deal with grieving people – you don’t need to say anything, just do something; make them a cup of tea, cook them dinner. To this day Michael brings fresh fish around to our house, drops it off and leaves without a word. He pretends to charge us for it, but we know that he doesn’t. These people, Luca’s parents, are as good as people get, and they love their son, Luca. So, Susie watches Love Island and cheers him on, and hopes that he will win. I also hope that Luca wins, and wins soon, because then I can get the fucking TV back.

Next Question

I just feel so fucking empty. So hollow. What can I do?","Dear John and Marina,

 It might be worth bearing in mind, Marina, that this emptiness that you feel, that we all feel to a greater or lesser degree, is not a condition in itself, rather it is an indicator of our own self-absorption, and signals a need. It asks something of us, this emptiness, this hollowness. It is a call. It is a call to meaning, and a call to love. It requires of us that we reach beyond our own dejection and attend to the condition of the world.

 For me, personally, this is the gift of The Red Hand Files. By their very nature your questions draw me out of my own self-absorption, by demanding an engagement with you all. This is not always easy, but a call to meaning rarely is – how happy we can feel in our own misery! How cosy! How safe! – and so I read the hundreds of questions that come in each week and do my best to reply, regardless of my state of mind, truthfully and in good faith.

 You ask me, John, what I want from The Red Hand Files. Well, the answer is this – I want to facilitate, in some small way, a mutual journey toward meaning; to decrease the dimensions of our emptiness and draw us closer to love and to beauty. I understand that these sound like grandiose claims, but they are not. This common project – to improve matters – is available to all of us, at every moment, and in a multitude of ways, and exists in the smallest kindness, the most rudimentary act of tolerance, or in the simplest generosity.

 Today, John and Marina, my advice is to go out and save the world. Smile and say ‘hello’ to the mean old bastard who lives next door, or the cranky cow at the corner shop, for they suffer too, and watch this small act of unsolicited kindness gather momentum and begin its journey around the world – watch it thunder and roar through the ages and change the nature of the cosmos itself.

 More grandiose claims? Hey, it’s my 200th post! Today, I can say what I like. Thank you everyone for improving the general condition of my life! I hope The Red Hand Files go some small way to improving yours. It is impossible to exaggerate just how unbelievably grateful I am to you all.

199,July 2022,https://www.theredhandfiles.com/do-you-have-a-safe-space,do-you-have-a-safe-space,1,ARIANNA,MILAN,ITALY,Do you have a safe space? How would you describe it?,"Dear Arianna,

 Safe spaces these days feel hard to come by – the world, in its nature, feels precarious and unsafe. But, after thinking about it for a while, I arrived at an answer which is probably kind of corny and influenced by the fact that, at the time of writing, I have been on tour for six weeks and, well, I miss my wife. My answer also involves a happy and serendipitous accident upon which the life I live now is built – having found a partner who loves me and whom I love. I understand that, in this regard, I am extraordinarily fortunate, and hugely privileged. I am happily married.

 But my ‘safe space’ is not the marriage itself. Far from it. A marriage is many things, and barely any of them are safe. A marriage, at its best, is challenging, dangerous, complicated and meaningful, and requires, like anything of true value, a certain amount of sacrifice and a certain amount of work. Inside it exists sorrows and joys, both big and small, and failures and triumphs too. But within this complex marital vortex there is, for me, a constant that never waivers – and here lies my safe space. My safe space is in the regard of my wife’s gaze. By this I mean when I look into the eyes of my wife I find a beauty, and this beauty has a moral value, of goodness; a goodness that manifests as a kind of benevolence. And that goodness reflects back and elicits my own goodness and, in turn, the necessary goodness of the world. Within this incoming and outpouring of reciprocal regard lies our mutual protection which is my saving and my wife’s saving. Put simply, we see each other, and through that seeing we want the best for each other, without condition – she has me and I have her. There, in the benevolent eyes of my wife, is my safest space and my truest privilege.

197,June 2022,https://www.theredhandfiles.com/thoughts-on-free-speech,thoughts-on-free-speech,2,LORRAINE; JASON,BERLIN; LONDON,GERMANY; UK,"What are your thoughts on free speech? Do you think it is a right?

Next Question

For fuck’s sake, enough of the God and Jesus bullshit!","Dear Lorraine and Jason,

 We humans are subtle and chaotic creatures, full of ambiguities and contradictions, and it is this that makes up our distinctiveness. We are fully and necessarily different from each other, and even though we have the entirely human tendency to reduce each other to generalisations based on arbitrary categorisations of identity, such as race or religion or gender, we must resist as best we can, for it is uncharitable at best to deny any human their rightful individual sovereignty, their specialness. It is our distinctiveness that is the very thing that should be prized.

 Each of us is an amalgam of all we have loved and lost and learned, our personal successes and failures, our particular regrets, and our singular joys – and part of that uniqueness is that we think in different ways. Not all of our thinking is right or fully formed, far from it, but there it is, regardless – that flawed and terrifying uniqueness of thought. So, it is little wonder that people adopt and signal a kind of protective groupthink, because our own true thoughts, at their most interesting, can be terrifying. In fact, humans are mostly distinct individuals thinking terrifying things.

 I’m not so sure free speech is a right, but it is certainly a societal or cultural attainment, something we, as a community, can use to enliven, embolden and liberate the soul of our world, provided we are fortunate enough to live in a society that allows such a thing. To be able to speak freely is not only a benefit to oneself, by making us feel less alone, it is also a barometer of the health of our society, just as intolerance to opposing ideas indicates a feebleness or lack of confidence in one’s own thoughts and the ideas of our society. I support free speech, not so much because I think it is a right, but rather because it goes some way to validate our specialness. I am genuinely concerned by its alternative, the fearful flattening of ideas through the suppression of our individual natures, something that has become all too evident in almost every institution I can think of.

 And so to Jesus, dear Jason. Jesus roamed the land expressing what were, at the time, considered dangerous and heretical ideas. He was literally the embodiment of the terrifying idea. He was followed around by a nervous coterie of muttering scribes and Sadducees whose purpose was to catch him out – expose not just His dangerous ideas, but to lay bare and persecute his uniqueness. They, of course, succeeded and Christ was cancelled upon the Cross. These impossible, dangerous ideas – to love your enemy, to love the poor, to forgive others – were terrifying and unconscionable and forbidden in His day, but became, in time, the better ideas that underpin the society in which many of us are lucky enough to live today. It is worth remembering that. I think we must be careful around our assumptions of what ideas we think are right and what ideas we think are wrong, and what we do with those ideas, because it is the terrifying idea – the shocking, offending, unique idea – that may just save the world.

196,June 2022,https://www.theredhandfiles.com/in-your-opinion-what-is-god,in-your-opinion-what-is-god,1,SUE,PARIS,FRANCE,"In your opinion, what is God?","Dear Sue,

 God is love, which is why I have difficulty relating to the atheist position. Every one of us, even the most spiritually resistant, yearns for love, whether we realise it or not. And this yearning calls us forever toward its objective – that we must love each other. We must love each other. And mostly I think we do – or we live in very close proximity to the idea, because there is barely any distance between a feeling of neutrality toward the world and a crucial love for it, barely any distance at all. All that is required to move from indifference to love is to have our hearts broken. The heart breaks and the world explodes in front of us as a revelation.

 There is no problem of evil. There is only a problem of good. Why does a world that is so often cruel, insist on being beautiful, of being good? Why does it take a devastation for the world to reveal its true spiritual nature? I don’t know the answer to this, but I do know there exists a kind of potentiality just beyond trauma. I suspect that trauma is the purifying fire through which we truly encounter the good in the world.

 Each day I pray into the silence. I pray to all of them. All of them who are not here. Into this emptiness, I pour all my desire and want and need, and in time this absence becomes potent and alive and activated with a promise. This promise that sits inside the silence is beauty enough. This promise, right now, is amazement enough. This promise, right now, is God enough. This promise, right now, is as much as we can bear.

Out of curiosity (and I suppose the entire casual web resulting in this message) what are your thoughts on this subject, is it still ok to show praise or to blame others for behaviour that is wholly and entirely out of their (and our) ultimate control? Even more curiously, how many people deserve writing credits when every single person alive (and who has ever lived before) has ultimately resulted in “your” finished song?","Dear J.I,

 This is the sort of question that I have absolutely no authority to answer. There are far cleverer people out there who have thought long and hard about these matters – determinism and the existence of free will – people who, with a yawn and slow swipe of their hand, could demolish practically anything I have to say on the matter.

 However, since you asked, I will say this: there seem to me to be some ideas that may very well be false, but are beneficial to a person or group of people to believe them. I, personally, would put the belief in God in that category. Similarly, there are other ideas that may very well be true, but it is simply not beneficial to a person, or society in general, to believe them. I would put determinism, or lack of free will, in that category. It is just untenable to base a society on the idea that we have no free will – that no one is responsible for their actions, whether they be good or bad.",https://www.theredhandfiles.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Picture-1.png,post thumbnail /post thumbnail

Do you have any recommendations on how I can create a sacred space that allows me to go in and shut the door and lock out the world?","Dear Brian,

 For most of my creative life I did indeed maintain an office at home. This office, with its massive desk, typewriter, shelves of books, and its accumulated piles of artefacts and self-absorbed scribblings, I considered to be my ‘sacred space’, a fortress where I could shut the door and lock out the world. But in time this office, my retreat, started to become a place of exclusion or of hiding, a place where I could turn away from the world, under the guise of being creative, at the expense of all else.

 In 2019 I gave my office – the desk and the entire contents – to the Royal Danish Library in Copenhagen for the very beautiful Stranger Than Kindness – The Nick Cave Exhibition. My office is currently in Montreal as it travels the world with the exhibition. Handing it over was one of the things that allowed me to find my way back to the world. Giving up my office helped set me free.

 I came to understand that the sacred space is the imagination itself, or rather the time spent inside the actual idea – the song you are composing, the story you are writing, or the picture you are painting. The sacred space, for the artist, is within the creative flow, at the crucial and fiery point of artistic intention, where time suddenly contracts and the work finds its power and its groove. My sacred space became the rolling fire of the imagination.

 But, you know, these days, I wonder about this too. Maybe these lofty claims about the imagination are yet more artistic hubris, a further place to hide, like the office – another invented way to separate ourselves from the world. Perhaps, the sacred space is simply the world itself – a hallowed place where we all exist at this time, where we engage with life in all its many tempers, within the present moment. Perhaps the thing we have spent so much time escaping, or attempting to create, was there all along – the blessed space, the sacred space, the truly creative place – the world around us.

191,April 2022,https://www.theredhandfiles.com/chris-baileys-amazing-voice,chris-baileys-amazing-voice,1,DAN,CONWAY,AUSTRALIA,"I just heard about Chris Bailey’s death. What an amazing voice, what an amazing scream. Can you tell us something about what he meant to you as a young musician in Australia?","Dear Dan,

 One week ago today, I was standing in front of a photo on display in the Stranger Than Kindness – The Nick Cave Exhibition in Montreal. It is an extraordinary photo that came to light a few years ago — it shows the singer, Chris Bailey, of the Brisbane band, the Saints, sitting collapsed on stage in a small club in Melbourne, watched by a very young and unformed Nick Cave. In the photo Chris is already committed to his life as perhaps the greatest and most anarchic rock ‘n’ roll singer Australia would ever produce. Conversely, I am in that stonewashed and uncertain state between failing art school and, well, I am not quite sure what. You can almost see the thought bubble forming above my head as an alternate plan presents itself.

 In the late seventies, the Saints came down from Brisbane and tore their way through Sydney and Melbourne with their famously seditious shows. It is impossible to exaggerate the resulting radical galvanising effect on the Melbourne scene – these legendary performances changed the lives of so many people, myself included.

 So, it is with immense sadness that we learn of Chris Bailey’s death. Too many great singers have died recently and, once again, I don’t have the words that will in any way adequately measure the extent of our collective loss. I can only simply repeat, for the record, that, in my opinion, the Saints were Australia’s greatest band, and that Chris Bailey was my favourite singer.

 Chris and I got to know each other well and went on to do a bunch of things together over the years, but it is this photo that I will treasure – a moment of realisation and divergence, as a drunk singer sits slumped on a stage floor, his very presence in that moment approximating some kind of moral purity or essential truth, and a young man watching transfixed, feeling his own best laid plans fall away as the thought bubble above his head fills with its sudden and outrageous revelation, ‘This is what I want to do and this is who I want to be.’

 With enormous gratitude to Chris Bailey and may he rest in peace.

I’m losing faith in other people, and I’m scared to pass these feelings to my little son. Do you still believe in Us (human beings)?","Dear Valerio,

 You are right to be worried about your growing feelings of cynicism and you need to take action to protect yourself and those around you, especially your child. Cynicism is not a neutral position — and although it asks almost nothing of us, it is highly infectious and unbelievably destructive. In my view, it is the most common and easy of evils.

 I know this because much of my early life was spent holding the world and the people in it in contempt. It was a position both seductive and indulgent. The truth is, I was young and had no idea what was coming down the line. I lacked the knowledge, the foresight, the self-awareness. I just didn’t know. It took a devastation to teach me the preciousness of life and the essential goodness of people. It took a devastation to reveal the precariousness of the world, of its very soul, to understand that it was crying out for help. It took a devastation to understand the idea of mortal value, and it took a devastation to find hope.

 Unlike cynicism, hopefulness is hard-earned, makes demands upon us, and can often feel like the most indefensible and lonely place on Earth. Hopefulness is not a neutral position either. It is adversarial. It is the warrior emotion that can lay waste to cynicism. Each redemptive or loving act, as small as you like, Valerio, such as reading to your little boy, or showing him a thing you love, or singing him a song, or putting on his shoes, keeps the devil down in the hole. It says the world and its inhabitants have value and are worth defending. It says the world is worth believing in. In time, we come to find that it is so.

Do you ever add an untrue component to a story to make it more interesting than it actually is?","Dear Chris and Nick,

 People mix me up with Nicolas Cage all the time. Like, I’ll be going through customs and the customs officer will look at my passport and say, ‘Happy to have you with us, Mr Cave. Loved you in Face/Off’. Or whatever. Sometimes it can be a bit of a pain in the neck, but you get used to it. Like, for instance, many years ago, I took Arthur and Earl, who were about seven at the time, to Healesville Sanctuary in Victoria to see the kangaroos and koalas and wombats and stuff. Arthur decided he wanted a didgeridoo for Christmas, so we stopped at the gift shop on the way out and, typically, Arthur chose the biggest didgeridoo in the shop. While we were waiting in the queue I noticed the girls behind the counter suddenly become super-animated and I heard one say, ‘Nic Cage is here‘ and they started sticking on lipstick and patting their hair, and I think, ‘Oh boy, here we go again.’ I get to the counter and buy the didgeridoo and while I’m paying, I say, ‘By the way, it’s Nick Cave. Nick Cave.’ The girls look at me a bit weird and we walk off to the car park, put the didgeridoo in the back of the car and head back to Melbourne. On the way home we stop at a pub in Lilydale. We order a counter meal and Arthur is trying to play the massive didgeridoo but gets sick of it and offloads it onto me because it’s too big and they are a lot harder to play than they look. The kids fuck off to the play area out the back of the pub and leave me at the counter with the didgeridoo. Suddenly, a security guy in a dark suit with an earpiece and shades steps out of nowhere and asks me if I’m Nick Cave. I say, ‘Well, yeah.’ He says, ‘Could you follow me, please.‘ So I follow the security guy into a small private room, adjacent to the main bar. Sitting there is Nicolas Cage. He is wearing a pork-pie hat and holding a didgeridoo. Nicolas Cage shouts, ‘Only one letter separates us!’ and leaps from his seat and eagerly pumps my hand. I’m pretty confused by all of this, but say, ‘It’s an honour to meet you, Mr Cage. Have you just been to Healesville Sanctuary?’ and he shouts, ‘Yes!’ and I say, ‘Well, me too.’ So we exchange a few pleasantries, eventually part ways and I go back to the main bar to eat my lunch. The kids are back from the play area and Arthur says ‘Where did you go, Dad?’ And I say, ‘I just met a very famous man, who basically has the same name as me.’ Right on cue, Nicolas Cage walks out of the adjoining room. His bodyguard opens the main door for him and, as he leaves, he looks back at me, grins that grin, and waves his didgeridoo. I wave mine back. I say to the kids, ‘That’s him. That’s Nicolas Cage. There goes a great man.’ And Arthur says, ‘Yeah, but your didgeridoo is bigger than his.’ And I rub his hair and say, ‘You said it, little guy.’ And that’s my Nic Cage story.

I picked this book up again during the first months of the pandemic after a specially harrowing day and I couldn’t put it down. By 3am I had gotten to the end again.
This time around I was that nameless father, alone in my own post-apocalyptic world, teaching and protecting my own daughter, looking for food and shelter where there is none, escaping the cannibals, surrounded by “good guys” who’ll betray you… but sometimes you’ll be the one who’ll hurt them even though you “carry the fire”, because ‘compassion vs cruelty’ and ‘good guys vs bad guys’ is an illusion… we are all just people doing what we think is best, trying really hard to live when everything seems charred and destroyed.
Tonight I decided to watch the movie, which I had been avoiding, but if Viggo Mortensen accepted the role it couldn’t be bad. Then I saw your name and Warren’s on the screen and it all made sense, so now I’m thinking that after 3 years of my last Red Hand File (I’m William from Issue #23) I thought I’d give you an update.
Me and my daughter are doing well. Early on in the pandemic we moved to LA to escape the Brooklyn one-bedroom and be closer to nature. I started a chocolate company called Flor de María, you’d love the religious imagery and tarot symbology I use in my packaging. This project and my daughter have been the focus of my life, you were right, my old life doesn’t exist anymore but I’ve built myself a new life and I’m glad to report that for the most part we’re happy. LA is a very isolating place but we’re enjoying a lot of time together. I took her to see Bjork, it was her first concert, she loved it until she had enough of the flutes. I’m taking her to see you and Warren on March 9th and she’s very excited to see you “rocking out”. I explained to her that this is not a Bad Seeds concert, but it also won’t be a Bjork accompanied by seven flutes concert. No pressure Nick, but an 8 year old will be judging. Say hello to Susie!
Much love and appreciation.","Dear William,

 Reading Issue #23 now, the letter you sent to me three years ago, our mutual devastation is palpable. I am happy that you and I are no longer in that place and it was a joy to get your letter.

 I think I saw you there at the Shrine concert, near to the front — a man with a small, masked girl who came close to the stage and stared up at me with giant, wonderful eyes, and who I sang to for a while. Maybe it wasn’t your daughter, maybe it was a different girl, but I guess that doesn’t matter.

 I feel very connected to you, William, in love and catastrophe, as if we are on an adventure together. Write to me, here at the Files, from time to time, and let me know how you both are doing.

You expressed clear and undivided solidarity with the Ukrainians, which they need all over the world right now. What bugs me about the Ukrainian message though is that you haven’t expressed such a support for the Palestinian people. Don’t get me wrong, I agree with your decision to play there, such boycotts, applied without qualification, has implications on freedom of thought, belief, and free speech. Moreover, it’s artists’ freedom that we hold so dearly. Still, at that time you haven’t expressed such clear and undivided solidarity with the Palestinian people who are also subjected to such a brutal treatment. In fact, you described Israel as a functioning democracy, and mapped out the solution as a political will shared by both sides. Yet, Israel is first and foremost the party responsible from the Palestinian suffering, in my opinion. And this saddens me, for this puts you on a position of a double standard.","Dear Ahmet,

 There is little I can disagree with in your letter, other than to say that the invasion of Ukraine by Russia is simply not the same thing as the ongoing conflict between Israel and Palestine; one is a brutal unprovoked attack on one state by another, in the hope of revising the entire security structure of Europe, and the other is a deeply complex clash of two nations that is far from straightforward. What the two conflicts do share is the tragic fate of all innocents who must cower in bomb shelters in fear of their lives, and I sympathise deeply with all such communities wherever — and whoever — they are.

 With respect, I do not wish to repeat my views on Israel/Palestine but with regards to showing my support to the Palestinian people, perhaps you should know that over the last twenty years I have taken part in several events to raise money for schools within their communities. But this is not the time for these debates, Ahmet. This is the time to unite in unequivocal support and love for the people of Ukraine.

 Right now, a catastrophe is unfolding and I stand with all Ukrainians at this horrific moment in history. I would like nothing more than to play in Kyiv and I was very much looking forward to our show there. I also have some wonderful fans in Russia and I know, through these very Files, that many people there vehemently oppose the actions of Putin’s regime. If I could play for those people too, I would.

 At this time let us just stand together with the people of Ukraine, and all those who cherish freedom and principles of national self-determination and want to live in peace and security with their neighbours.

He seemed to be one of the most highly regarded and respected musicians by his peers. A rare lyrical talent with a voice like no other.,"Dear Anton and everyone who has written to me about Mark,

 I encountered Mark many times over the years — we engaged in some extremely dubious escapades back in the ’90s; he sang ‘White Light/White Heat’ and ‘Fire and Brimstone’ with Warren and me on the Lawless soundtrack; he recorded my favourite ever Nick Cave cover — an astonishing version of ‘Brompton Oratory’; we did something together for the Jeffrey Lee Pierce record, I think; and he toured and hung out with us on The Bad Seeds’ 2013 Australian tour.

 Go online and watch Mark sing Blixa’s ‘father’ part with me in ‘The Weeping Song’ on that tour. As a frontman, I move around a lot on stage, I can’t help it, it is a habitual nervous thing, a kind of neurotic compensation for a voice I have never felt that comfortable with. But watch Mark, watch how he walks onto the stage, plants himself at the mic stand, one tattooed fist halfway down the stand, the other resting on top of the mic, immobile, massive, male. When the time comes to sing, he simply opens his mouth and releases a blues, a blues lived deeply and utterly earned, and that voice tears right through you, his sheer force on stage absolutely humbling. A greatness, Mark, a greatness — a true singer, a superb writer and beautiful soul, loved by all.

 I am sitting here looking at this year’s calendar. My assistant, Rachel, has helpfully laid it out in various child-friendly, primary-coloured blocks. A red block means touring, a blue block means other extracurricular creative stuff, and a yellow block means time off. The year is largely big, red blocks, with some sudden moments of blue, and a little lonely threadbare patch of yellow. Of the three red blocks, one is the imminent American Carnage tour with Warren, starting in Asheville and ending in Montreal. This block of red fills me with a kind of unabated joy because the show is just so beautiful. The second red block is a full-on Bad Seeds summer festival tour across the UK, Europe and elsewhere. This fills me with a combination of extreme excitement and acute terror because, well, it’s long and punishing. Finally, I can see, glowing lovely, glowing redly, a Nick and Warren Australian Carnage tour that has been recently added. This has not yet been announced — and I will no doubt be reprimanded for doing so here on The Red Hand Files — but I can see it there, that bright, red block, beginning mid-November and ending mid-December. This new addition makes me very happy. In fact, quite literally, it brings tears of joy, Astrid! Home, Ally, home!

 But, beginning today, palely pulsing, is a two week yellow block. This means a break, Leo. This fills me with a certain trepidation because I’m going off-line for the duration, as of now. Susie claims to be doing the same. We shall see.

Next Question

When I watch you play live my soul is lifted but I am not sure what that even means. It feels religious! What is the soul? See you in Montreal!","Dear Jane and Reese,

 The soul is the condition of the body that gives our lives meaning. When the soul is energized our spirits are literally lifted, and we can participate in what could be called a religious experience. Music is the supreme exemplar of art as pure meaning because it directly animates the soul. All other art forms aspire to the religious condition but music is the utmost conduit to the truly transcendent encounter.

 To walk on stage and perform a series of songs is an attempt to invigorate the collective soul of an audience. Whatever is happening to the soul of the audience is also happening to the soul of the performer. This mutuality is a circular and escalating intaking and outpouring of love. It is, by its very nature, a religious experience because it is in the service of a greater transcendent goodness. It is truth.

 The lifting of the soul is universal and can be experienced in any opera house or rock ‘n’ roll dive in the world and is, in my opinion, a legitimate religious experience. It is not an imitation.

 Warren and I start rehearsing for our North American tour tomorrow. Jane, Reese, we can’t wait.

Next Question

Where do we find meaning in life?","Dear Elise and Assaf,

 Susie has hung a cuckoo clock in the garden of our house in London. Behind the house there is a primary school, obscured by a high, ivy-covered wall, and each day we hear the sounds of children playing. To the side of the house, across the lane, is a church. The church is forever tolling its bell. Right now everything seems to be happening at once. The crazy cuckoo clock marks out time — cuckoo! cuckoo! cuckoo!, the children scream in the schoolyard, and the bells from the church ring forth, promising us everlasting life. I sit here with my wife, two people placed within this cosmic drama, drinking coffee, absorbed in our separate temporary worlds — right now hers is Instagram and mine is answering your questions.

 Elise, you asked if I would live forever if I could, well, the answer must be no. I wouldn’t because, as far as I can see, the meaning of life is nested within the set terms of our own mortality. ‘Forever’ is both incomprehensible and utterly meaningless. I don’t believe we live just for the sake of it; rather we live our lives within the poetry of our own demise, within our own time, and our own limitations, and for that very reason alone we do so meaningfully. We work, we love, we care for each other, and we suffer together, knowing that one day we will die. The children in the schoolyard run headlong toward adulthood and their own disappearance, and we adults are the living breathing reminders of that. The man who waves at me as he walks his dog up the lane will die, as will the people filing into the church at the ringing of the bell, and the shop assistant hurrying to work, and the parking inspector, and the street sweeper, all will die in time — oh, and the squirrel (ah, there he is), he too will die (ouch), and the flowers, the swaying trees, and the earth itself. It is toward this temporal inconvenience — our finitude — that we move, with only a few precious moments to add value to this world. What can we do in this time that we are given, that is running through our fingers, even now? How can we lighten our mutual predicament that is drawing ever closer? Assaf, there lies the meaning in life — it is in the expansion of ourselves, in our benevolence, to fully occupy our allotted time.

 And so the cuckoo stops cuckooing, and the little wooden bird retreats to await the next hour, the children have gone back to class, and the church bells fall silent as those inside kneel and pray, and the startled sunlight catches the side of my wife’s face with sudden purpose. Unaware, she scrolls and scrolls.

 Nothing you create is ultimately your own, yet all of it is you. Your imagination, it seems to me, is mostly an accidental dance between collected memory and influence, and is not intrinsic to you, rather it is a construction that awaits spiritual ignition. 

 Your spirit is the part of you that is essential. It is separate from the imagination, and belongs only to you. This formless pneuma is the invisible and vital force over which we toss the blanket of our imagination — that habitual mix of received information, of memory, of experience — to give it form and language. In some this vital spirit burns fiercely and in others it is a dim flicker, but it lives in all of us, and can be made stronger through daily devotion to the work at hand.

 In my view, John, worry less about what you make — that will mostly look after itself, and is to some extent beyond your control, and perhaps even none of your business — and devote yourself to nourishing this animating spirit. Bring all your enthusiasm to bear on the development of that good and essential force. This is done by a commitment to the creative act itself. Each time you tend to that ingenious spark it grows stronger, and sets afire the ordinary gifts of the imagination. The more dedication you show to the process, the better the work, and the greater your gift to the world. Apply yourself fully to the task, let go of the outcome, and your true voice will appear. You’ll see. It can be no other way.

The mark of the beast is given to someone who is a slave to their impulses.
They allow their instincts and other innate processes to dictate their behaviour.
People who act badly because of their suffering are reacting instinctively to an innate sensation and have allowed themselves to become beastlike rather than a being of free will.
We are sent suffering because if we are able to overcome it and still act morally, we have achieved greater sentience and moral strength.
The most powerful example of this is Jesus, who in the midst of suffering said, “Forgive them they know not what they do.”
Please ignore me if these messages are a problem, but I have messages from Up, so I don’t know what to do really.
This has been weird.

Next Question

Sorry I have a leak in my head.
Acting morally wrong means we have lower sentience and are more beastlike because we are doing something without understanding the full consequences of our actions. God is the ultimate good because he knows everything and is able to act perfectly. We can choose not to act well, but that breaks the system, which supports us and ultimately causes harm, which is an evil.

Next Question

This is ridiculous, I was fine for months.
I think that calling failure to overcome suffering the mark of the beast is demonic corruption again.
Are we damned for being in pain?
Do you have any advice for dealing with demonic possession?
I could try to get an exorcism but I doubt they’d listen and also I’d miss them.

Also, I have been reading the confounding ‘devouring lion’ passage in The Gospel of Thomas and am finding it difficult to understand — perhaps you could shed some light on it. Finally, do you know the passage in The Little Prince, where the prince meets a fox? Does this apply? I don’t know —

 “Come and play with me,” he says to the fox.

 “I cannot play with you,” the fox replies. “I am not tamed.”

 “What does that mean — to tame?”

 He goes on to say —

 “One only understands the things that one tames.”

Next Question

How much influence do your friends have?","Dear Renata and Gerry,

 I don’t have a favourite poem as it changes daily. I do have three poets on the go at the moment, though, who are all bringing me an enormous amount of insight and pleasure.

 The first is the Persian lyric poet, Hafiz — who my friend, the sculptor, Thomas Houseago, calls ‘the great trickster’. Thomas recommended Daniel Ladinsky’s revelatory book, A Year with Hafiz, and I read one of these beautiful poems each day. Today, Hafiz talks of his role as a poet to be little more than shaped potential brought alive by the creative spirit —

  

 “I am the hole in a flute that the Christ’s breath moves through”

  

 I am also revisiting Rainer Maria Rilke’s mind-blowing Duino Elegies. I was recently reminded of this collection by Philip, a young painter & neighbour at my ceramics studio, who spoke of them with such utter love, I felt compelled to read them again. Rilke talks of his gifting spirit as a terrifying angel —

  

 “Perilous behind the stars”

  

 And thirdly, a few weeks ago I was introduced to the work of Lucille Clifton by my email-pal, journalist, Suzanne Moore. I now happily own a massive volume of Clifton’s collected works. I read, at random, one of her amazing poems each day. New Year’s Day gave me this poem, and it couldn’t be more appropriate for me, as a writer who yet still feels that ‘early lunge toward language’.

  

 the birth of language

  

 and adam rose

 fearful in the garden

 without words

 for the grass

 his fingers plucked

 without a tongue

 to name the taste

 shimmering in his mouth

 did they draw blood

 the blades did it become

 his early lunge

 toward language

 did his astonishment

 surround him

 did he shudder

 did he whisper

 eve

 These poems all speak to us of the imaginative and animating spirit that belongs to us all. As we try to fathom this coming year, let’s pray we can live it creatively, in the name of that most obscure and tentative utterance, love — our ‘eve’.

 I hope everyone has a wonderful 2022.

Next Question

Are you an optimist?

Next Question

What does Christmas mean to you?","Dear Anna, Raymond and Greg,

 Hope and optimism can be different, almost opposing, forces. Hope rises out of known suffering and is the defiant and dissenting spark that refuses to be extinguished. Optimism, on the other hand, can be the denial of that suffering, a fear of facing the darkness, a lack of awareness, a kind of blindness to the actual. Hope is wised-up and disobedient. Optimism can be fearful and false. However, there exists another form of optimism, a kind of radical optimism. This optimism has experienced the suffering of the world, believes in the insubordinate nature of hope and is forever at war with banal pessimism, cynicism and nihilism.

 As we move into Christmas, the image of Jesus in the manger — what Yeats calls the ‘uncontrollable mystery on the bestial floor’ — is that hope and that radical optimism incarnate.

 I want to thank everyone who has supported The Red Hand Files through this difficult year. This week has seen our 50,000th question and each and every one fills me with that very hope and radical optimism.

Next Question

How do I not have my heart broken?","Dear Mauro and Jenny,

 The surest way to avoid a broken heart is to love nothing and no-one — not your partner, your child, your mother or father, your brothers or sisters; not your friends; not your neighbour; not your dog or your cat; not your football team, your garden, your granny or your job. In short, love not the world and love nothing in it. Beware of the things that draw you to love — music, art, literature, cinema, philosophy, nature and religion. Keep your heart narrow, hard, cynical, invulnerable, impenetrable, and shun small acts of kindness; be not merciful, forgiving, generous or charitable — these acts expand the heart and make you susceptible to love — because as Neil Young so plainly and painfully sings, ‘Only love can break your heart.’ In short, resist love, because real love, big love, true love, fierce love, is a perilous thing, and travels surely towards its devastation. A broken heart — that grief of love — is always love’s true destination. This is the covenant of love.

 However, Mauro, to resist love and inoculate yourself against heartbreak is to reject life itself, for to love is your primary human function. It is your duty to love in whatever way you can, and to move boldly into that love — deeply, dangerously and recklessly — and restore the world with your awe and wonder. This world is in urgent need — desperate, crucial need — and is crying out for love, your love. It cannot survive without it.

 To love the world is a participatory and reciprocal action — for what you give to the world, the world returns to you, many fold, and you will live days of love that will make your head spin, that you will treasure for all time. You will discover that love, radical love, is a kind of supercharged aliveness, and all that is of true value in the world is animated by it. And, yes, heartache awaits love’s end, but you find in time that this too is a gift — this little death — from which you are reborn, time and again. I have only one piece of advice for you both, and it is the very best that I can give. Love. The world is waiting.

There are indeed some acts that are reprehensible, that are simply beyond the pale, and we need to be alert to this, to be repelled by these acts, in order that we do not repeat them, or draw these offences back into our lives. It runs contrary to our own sense of human dignity and justice to think otherwise. However, even though the act may appear unforgivable, forgive we must.

 To forgive is perhaps the supreme human capacity, it can feel counter-intuitive yet it is wholly crucial to our survival, not just of our own selves, but also of our species in general. It is what Derrida calls, ‘a madness of the impossible’. In short, we must strive to forgive the unforgivable.

 This act of radical forgiveness is exceedingly difficult because our instinct for justice and vengeance feels far more natural and human than to find it in ourselves to forgive, however, as is clear from your letter, this instinct turned inward can be absolutely disastrous.

 There is a way forward though, and it is this — we must attempt to separate the act itself from the person who has carried it out. We condemn the act but we are merciful to the one who committed it. This can feel like an impossibility, especially when the person who needs clemency is oneself. However, the fact that you feel so abject about whatever you did indicates that you are indeed heading toward some form of absolution.

 We all have regrets and, as bad as they may feel, they are signals of our growth as human beings. A person with no regrets is simply leading an unexamined life. Personally I try to look at our trespasses not as sins but as sufferings — that we have at our core an essential goodness, but that over time this goodness is loaded up with layers of suffering that lead ultimately to all manner of fucked-up behaviour.

 It is worth bearing in mind that we are mostly good people who do bad things — all of us — and forgiveness, as contrary to our instincts as it so often feels, is the crucial component that can usher us out of the darkness and back to the world.

Next Question

How do you describe friendship? How important is friendship for your creativity?

Next Question

What a wonderfully emotional and intense performance at the Brighton Dome. Love and joy radiated every time you interacted with Warren, so I’d like to ask, what qualities do you look for in a friend, are your friends similar or a mixed bag and does the very special, often enduring love that friendship can bring influence your songwriting?","Dear Fred, Ozden and Jo,

 There seems to me to be three levels of friendship.

 First there is the friend who you go out and eat with, or get pissed with, who you go with to the cinema or a gig — you know, have a shared experience with.

 The second kind of friend is one who you can ask a favour of, who will look after you in a jam, will lend you money, or drive you to the hospital in the middle of the night, someone who has your back — that kind of friend.

 The third level of friendship is one where your friend brings out the best in you, who amplifies the righteous aspects of your nature, who loves you enough to be honest with you, who challenges you, and who makes you a better person.

 None of these levels are mutually exclusive and sometimes you find someone who fulfils all of these categories. If you find a friend like that, hang on to him or her. They are rare.

 Warren is such a friend. The reason why we have had such a long and productive artistic collaboration is because these three levels of friendship are firmly in place; we understand the nature of friendship and we look after the friendship itself.

 When Warren and I are playing music together, we do not have to deal with the problems of an unstable relationship, or questions of status, or struggles for power. We are friends, pure and simple, and we just get on with the work at hand — two people creating something greater than the sum of its parts — the fruits of the collaboration emerging directly from the friendship itself.

 Mostly I have been spending time in the studio working on my ceramic figurines. This is a great pleasure for me as the project slowly inches towards completion.

 I have also just finished a recording called Seven Psalms. It is spoken word, essentially, set to very beautiful music, if I may say so myself. Each psalm is made up of three four-line verses and addresses a different spiritual concern — joy, guilt, evil, adulation etc. The seven are recorded as one long piece. Not for everyone, to be sure, but a lovely thing all the same. I’m not sure what I will do with it, or when it will be released, but, Iain, here is Psalm Six.

  

 Such Things Should Never Happen

 Such things should never happen but we die

 The swallow finds an oak to nest her young

 Defenceless between the earth and the sky

 Uncounted beneath a vast, indifferent sun

  

 A mother holds her baby to her breast

 She trusts in you yet does not dare to breathe

 As the baby swallow falls from its nest

 As the mighty oak does not appear to see

  

 Such things should never happen but they do

 In a darkened room, a mother cries

 The swallow seeks to build its nest anew

 The oak tree lifts its branches to its eyes

What’s the crack with the squirrel?","Dear Astrid, Johnny and Nik,

 Susie and I have a squirrel. His name is Chaos. He has essentially moved in. He wasn’t our idea. We have no control over him. We will be sitting quietly watching TV and he will come flying down the stairs and sit on the table and watch us watching TV. It is unnerving, but neither Susie nor I will admit it. Sometimes he suddenly shoots around the living room, springing from chair to sofa to table to chair, creating havoc. But most of the time Chaos just sits and watches us quietly watching TV.

 Chaos doesn’t give a fuck about anything that we give a fuck about — like sleeping or working or watching TV. He has no sense of propriety, no boundaries, no basic civility. Sometimes, when I am working, he leaps up on the table and runs all over my shit. In the morning he comes through the top window and jumps on my bed and, once I am awake, he runs down the stairs and sits on the kitchen table and eats an apple from the fruit bowl, or a nut from the nut jar. Then he goes flying around the room creating havoc. I sit there in my pyjamas and drink coffee, and then he stops flying around the room and sits on the kitchen table, watching me in my pyjamas, watching him. I hate to admit it, but it is unnerving. I speak to him in hushed tones. He climbs all over me. He has no boundaries. He is Chaos. He wasn’t our idea. He is never going away. We are not in control. We never were.

 This morning, when I opened the front door of our house, there were two squirrels, Chaos, and a friend I guess. The friend is too scared to come inside. Susie and I prefer the friend. He has a sense of decorum, he has boundaries, he has some sense of decency. We have called him Order. Neither of them were our idea. We just want to quietly watch TV. We just want things to go back to the way they were.

Next Question

You seem to have lived in many different countries. Why did you leave Brighton? Where do you live now?

Next Question

Aren’t you just so fucking angry?","Dear Will, Linda and Helen,

 It is very difficult to recall the circumstances around many of the songs on Part 2 of the B Sides & Rarities album because most of them were written in the period immediately after my son died. Part of my own experience of grief has been a kind of forgetting – where significant portions of my life following Arthur’s death seem largely lost to me, or rather so misremembered that they have little relation to the truth.

 I have just listened again to ‘Heart That Kills You’ and can tell by the lyric that it was clearly written after Arthur’s death, and is probably a rejected or forgotten song fragment that found its way into the sessions Warren and I did leading up to the making of Ghosteen. It has that yearning, questing sound.

 The song deals with Adam and Eve, a recurring husband and wife motive that seems to have been used in a few songs at that time. It begins –

  

 Adam watches his little Eve

 Sleeping in a grief of snow

  

 The lovers have been expelled from their ordinary Eden by the appearance of serpents that come in the form of a catastrophe, and –

  

 Sink inside her with their fangs

  

 The verse ends with the lines –

  

 No, we cannot stay, like apples we will drop

 And stepped from the garden into L.A.

  

 The second verse is set on the flight to Los Angeles and begins with the line –

  

 We are beginning our descent

  

 Eve looks out the window and watches –

  

 Babies riding in the clouds, turning into clouds

  

 As the plane – ‘the tin can’ – tilts downward

  

 And like an apple drops

 Into old and angry age

  

 I rarely look to the past and so I am grateful you sent me back to this song because it holds some lovely little pulses of lyrical pleasure. I say this as someone who has no recollection of the song’s conception or intention, and who feels he barely had much to do with the writing of it at all.

 The words of the song go someway toward articulating why Susie and I moved from Brighton to L.A. Brighton had just become too sad. We did, however, return once we realised that, regardless of where we lived, we just took our sadness with us. These days, though, we spend much of our time in London, in a tiny, secret, pink house, where we are mostly happy.

 The ‘forgetting’ aspect of grieving is something that is only just starting to come to light because, well, it is hard to remember not remembering something. I had a long talk about this with Warren as we drove between cities on the recent tour. It seems I lost a year, more or less, where we did six film scores in a row, in the little studio we use in Ovingdean, overlooking the churchyard where Arthur is buried.

  

 Into old and angry age

  

 – goes the final line of the song. It turns out that this line did not prove to be true. As Susie and I grow older, the anger at the indifference and casual cruelty of this world can still burn bright, but it does not define us, for the oxygen that fuels that anger is love – love for the world and love for the people in it. Love becomes anger’s great animator, as it should, as it must.

What attracted you: did you know the life and work of Louis Wain or was it the fact you were playing H.G Wells that made you want to take on the part?

Next Question

I have heard and loved your collaborations with David Tibet. How did you meet him?

Next Question

How does it feel to be back from the tour?","Dear Mathilde, Lee and Pamela,

 In Melbourne, back in the late 70s, my friend, the artist Tony Clark, showed me a book of Louis Wain paintings. For those who don’t know, Louis Wain was an Edwardian artist who painted anthropomorphised — or humanised — cats. His art has a visionary intensity that is uniquely his own, and the book, quite simply, blew my mind. I fast became a Wain disciple.

 A few years later, in London, I was introduced to the musician, poet and artist, David Tibet, who had an extensive collection of Louis Wain paintings. David and I became very good friends and met regularly, together with screenwriter, Geoff Cox, at a Spanish restaurant in Notting Hill where we talked art and religion — and got pissed. Over the years David sold me some of his Louis Wain paintings, and I also collected them from other sources. I had a sizeable collection for a while but it has dwindled of late, as I have given them away to friends and family and museums.

 I happily accepted the role of the writer H. G. Wells in the movie, ‘The Electrical Life of Louis Wain’, not just because of my long and abiding love of Louis Wain, but because the script was good, the role was relatively unchallenging, and I didn’t have to cut my hair like H.G. Wells. It is a beautiful, heartfelt hallucination of a film about a most singular and extraordinary man. I highly recommend it.

 Pamela, it is difficult to exaggerate how much the tour with Warren meant to me. It was a glorious thing — a show that was free to morph and change and blossom. It was truly affecting to see people learn how to be an audience again after all these months, just as we had to work out how to do a show again.

 It is good to be home though, and to open my laptop and read the hundreds of questions that have banked up over the last couple of weeks, and be reminded of the great privilege it is for me to be a part of this project with you all.

 The truth is, it is very hard. Playing these concerts is pure happiness, more than I have experienced in a very long time. I cannot tell you what it means to Warren and me to walk out on stage and perform the songs — but there is a level of intensity to the shows that is exhausting. As the tour progresses, the energy needed to treat The Red Hand Files with the care and responsibility that your questions deserve is draining out of me like water from a little leaky pot. Rather than give replies to your questions that aren’t properly thought through, I have decided to take a break for the next two weeks and then begin again once the tour has finished. I hope you all understand.

Next Question

What is ‘Lavender Fields’ about?","Dear Jacob and Amy,

 During lockdown I engaged in a series of very long and wide-ranging phone conversations — sometimes for three or four hours at a time — with friend and writer, Sean O’Hagan. At some point we decided to record the conversations and put them in a book, which Canongate will publish next year.

 One of the things we discussed in these freewheeling conversations was our mutual interest in religion, and Sean remarked that he felt I was, in that regard, travelling ‘a singular road’. I found that comment amusing. After the call, I wrote the gently self-mocking lines —

  

 I’m travelling appallingly alone

 On a singular road

  

 These two lines brought with them a gift from the gods! ‘Lavender Fields’ fell out of the celestial birth canal, fully formed, purple and smack into my lap. For me, songs rarely come that easily!

 The image of travelling through fields of lavender felt full of promise —

  

 Through the lavender fields

 That reach high beyond the sky

  

 — on a ‘singular road’ with its gentle irony, because my road is not singular at all, but the road we all travel, by and by.

  

 People ask me how I’ve changed

 I say it is a singular road

 And the lavender has stained my skin

 And made me strange

  

 The song is mostly about change, as is the whole ‘Carnage’ album, moving away from one state of being toward another, or so it seems to me.

 Even the conversion vision of the final verse, the pale bird, of which I was particularly pleased, brings with it a kind of spiritual renewal —

  

 Sometimes I see a pale bird wheeling

 In the sky

 But that is just a feeling

 A feeling when you die

  

 The song ends, but all is not as it seems, because slowly a gorgeous hymn rises to the surface and eventually overwhelms the song, escorting the traveller to his or her destination — that of transcendent change.

  

 We don’t ask who

 And we don’t ask why

 There is a kingdom in the sky

  

 But ‘Lavender Fields’ is probably best listened to without too much concern for what it is about, rather it is a song that has, built into Warren’s ever-rising chord sequence, the power to transport us — up and away, away.

 By the way, ‘Lavender Fields’ played live, with our awe-inspiring singers, Wendi, Janet and T Jae, is amazing — just saying.

167,September 2021,https://www.theredhandfiles.com/anyones-muse,anyones-muse,1,SANDRA,LONDON,UK,"I read a quote in a magazine recently from Susie. I thought it was interesting. “To be honest, I find the word muse to be a little demeaning. I haven’t really got time to be anyone’s muse. However, I am a frequent visitor in my husband’s songs, I seem to be always walking in and out of them. His songs look after me. And if I am to be a muse, then I am his and he is mine.” What do you think about that?","Dear Sandra,

 I have never been all that comfortable with the term ’muse’ either. I think the problem with the word is that traditionally ‘muse’ feels female and takes a secondary position, as the source of inspiration for the male artist — a kind of sanctifying of a subordinate role. So there is something about it that feels a little undermining, as if the muse has nothing else to do but hang around energizing the artist. Having said that, Susie is, without a doubt, my point of influence and I spend most of my creative life journeying back and forth along the axis of her wonderfulness.

 She is right in saying about my songs, “I always seem to be walking in and out of them”, because I rarely sit down to write a song about Susie, rather, when I am in that indeterminate space it can become difficult to maintain my own perspective and I find myself adopting hers — slipping from one voice to another. Sometimes I hear three voices in my songs — my voice, Susie’s and our shared voice.

 I love her words, “His songs look after me”. I don’t know what to say about them, and I’m not sure I completely understand them, but I like them all the same.

Next Question

I’m a new subscriber and you’ve probably been asked and answered this question before – why did you start The Red Hand Files?","Dear Neill and Chantal,

 I started The Files three years ago this week. I feel dizzy just saying that, and what I started, essentially on an intuition, has now become a fundamental part of my life.

 Chantal, for a long time I’d wanted to explore the idea of some form of communication with my audience that sat outside of music. I felt I had things to share that didn’t fit within the normal confines of what I did artistically. I wasn’t at all sure what form that would take but it was a nagging thought that I carried with me. I was searching for something.

 Then my son, Arthur, died and everything changed. People began to send letters to my home address, letters of condolence, of course, but many were letters from people that essentially said, “This happened to me. I know what you are going through.” It was clear that people were finding some sort of personal salvation by articulating their own particular story for somebody else to hear. It felt to me that they had run out of people who were prepared to listen. This idea had a profound impact on me — the remarkable curative power of the combined acts of telling and listening. In time, this would become the basic premise for The Red Hand Files.

 You see, The Red Hand Files are not just about answering the enquiry, they are first and foremost about listening to the question. I get about fifty to a hundred letters a day and part of my commitment to the project is to read each question carefully, and be alert to what each person is trying to say.

 This practice of reading the questions is, in its way, a form of prayer, because prayer is primarily about listening. It allows the necessary space to experience the subtle intimations of the divine, and to acknowledge God’s divine need — what is required of us. In the questions that come into The Red Hand Files I feel this same want echoed in my own need, the speaking of one’s pain into the pain of another, the toing and froing of our mutual desire for simple affirmation. So, here I am, and there you are, and happy third birthday to us all.

 I didn’t know about this project, so thank you for alerting me to it. I have a whole lot of time for The Flaming Lips — really like a lot of their stuff, have been an admirer since watching them play most evenings on the Lollapalooza Festival tour in ’94, maybe even sang with them there, and wrote a song for one of their records. This version of Girl in Amber is just lovely, I was going to say Nell Smith inhabits the song, but that’s wrong, rather she vacates the song, in a way that I could never do. I always found it difficult to step away from this particular song and sing it with its necessary remove, just got so twisted up in the words, I guess. Nell shows a remarkable understanding of the song, a sense of dispassion that is both beautiful and chilling. I just love it. I’m a fan.

Next Question

What’s with the duplicate question bullshit?","Dear Kevin, Ray, Sarah and Barbara,

 About ten years ago I decided that it might be a good idea to get in shape for an upcoming tour and so I booked some training sessions at a local gym in Brighton. I’d never trained or even entered a gym before and I also didn’t have any kit, and so, in preparation, I ordered a tracksuit from Amazon. When it arrived the tracksuit was very small — I think it was actually a child’s size. I had forgotten to order trainers but found an old pair of giant white sneakers that had belonged to one of the kids. As I left the house for my first session at the gym I was aware that I looked ridiculous and so I stuck on a bucket hat that was lying around in an effort to disguise myself.

 I spent the most punishing hour of my life in the gym that day, with a trainer who, as far as I’m concerned, basically violated me. Drenched in sweat, I left the gym vowing never to return. On the drive home I suddenly remembered that I had promised Susie that I would pick her up from Heathrow — I also realised that I was late and had no time to go home to change out of my gym clothes but I thought, ‘Fuck it, I’ll drive straight to the airport, run into the terminal to meet her and then get out of there, no one will see me.’

 When I arrived at the airport I needed to have a piss so I stopped at the bathrooms and as I walked back out, in my tiny tracksuit, my giant white trainers and my bucket hat, there, walking toward me, was Charlie Watts of The Rolling Stones. He had silver hair and was dressed in an elegant pearl-grey three piece suit, a button down checked shirt and a tie. He literally glowed with a kind of inner serenity, and as we passed each other we locked eyes for a moment and he smiled at me — not an unkind smile, but not a kind one either, rather the impassive look one animal might give to another in the wild, that signalled their complete and total supremacy.

 As I watched Charlie Watts disappear into the crowd, I rearranged my bucket hat, and thought, “There goes a truly great drummer,” which is what I thought when I heard the news this week of his passing — “There goes a truly great drummer.”

Nick, the bar “Mercearia São Pedro”, a place you used to go when you lived in São Paulo, will close its doors and be replaced by an expensive building. What do you think about it?","Dear Alex and Lucas,

 In the early nineties I lived in an area of São Paulo called Vila Madalena with my then partner, Viviane, and our son, Luke. At the end of our street was Merceario São Pedro, a grocery store that doubled as an outdoor bar. Every day at around 11 o’clock I would round up Luke, who was about two at the time, and together we would set out up the hill to Pedro’s. I would sit Luke up on a stool next to me at the bar and we would eat cheese pastels, and the owner, Pedro, would talk to Luke till the workers came in for lunch. We would then shift to a table on the pavement outside and sit in the sun. I would read and write stuff and Luke would suck his dummy, or on a Chupa Chup which Pedro had slipped him on the sly. I guess I wrote some lyrics during those times, ‘The Ship Song’ and ‘Papa Won’t Leave You, Henry’ and ‘Foi Na Cruz’, but mostly I just sat and smoked cigarettes and drank a beer and talked to Luke, while he sucked his Chupa Chup and watched and listened.

 Those days at São Pedro’s were simple and good. They were the best of times. Now, developers are tearing the bar down and building a luxury apartment block in its place. I understand that this is the way of world — things come and go — and I know that we are facing more pressing problems than the demolition of a little bar in Sao Paulo, yet even still, a piece of Vila Madalena’s soul will be lost when they rip that place down, and a piece of mine too.

 So, I say goodbye to Merceario São Pedro, the world’s greatest bar, and I say thank you to Pedro, for the kindness that he always showed to my little boy, Luke.

 Hal Willner was a great man with a beautiful soul. He died of Covid-19 on the evening of April 7th, 2020. His death was sudden and shocking and a deep blow to us all. If there had been a vaccine available at that time Hal may still be alive today.

 I had my second jab on 26th May and I can now live in this embattled world knowing that if I catch Covid there is little chance of me dying from it. I feel privileged to live in an age where our scientists are able to develop a vaccine to help combat a pandemic, and to do it at such an astonishing speed. It feels to me that this is a momentous time in medical history.

 As for the prophylactic use of Ivermectin, I know little about this other than the evidence for its effectiveness appears speculative.

 As for the soul, last time I checked mine seemed to be doing fine. I suspect the soul is robust enough to stand its ground against a remedy that will save so many lives. But who really knows about matters of the soul?

If you haven’t heard of him he was an artist from England who wrote only about 60 songs about love, regret, happiness and some emotions I can’t really describe. He sadly suffered from depression and died from an overdose only 4 years into his career. I may be very wrong in thinking so but do you feel that you share more than your first name with Drake?

Next Question

Have you ever met a hero that didn’t disappoint?","Dear Raghav and Pamela,

 Whenever I have heard Nick Drake’s music over the years I have enjoyed it, but that’s not the reason for replying to your letter, Raghav. I want to tell you a story, a sort of Nick Drake story, and try to answer your question, Pamela, in the process.

 Sometime in the early eighties, on London’s Portobello Road, I was approached by a man who wanted to take my photograph. He said that I looked ‘interesting’. He gave me his address and told me to come to his flat the next day. This is before I had developed an acute dislike of having my photograph taken, and when I was dumb enough to think that going to a stranger’s flat to have my photo taken might be a good idea. Anyway, the next day I went to his place, somewhere in Ladbroke Grove.

 Inside the flat, the photographer told me he had to set up his camera and asked me to sit and wait on a little sofa in the middle of his rather dark living room. I remember that there was an unsettling atmosphere in the room, heavy and strange, but I sat down anyway.

 After a while, I felt a presence behind me, as someone entered the room, walked slowly around the sofa, and then very carefully sat down beside me. It took me a moment to realise that this person, this woman, was the singer, Nico. Now, Pamela, at that time in my young life, Nico, who had sung with The Velvet Underground and made some classic solo albums herself, was, by any measure, a hero, and she was there beside me, sitting very still, and wearing green rubber, knee-high wellingtons. She didn’t speak for a long time. Then she turned slowly toward me, and said, very deliberately, in her thick German accent –

 “I knew a boy who was just like you.”

 I said, “Oh yeah?”

 She said, “He was a singer and his name was Nick.”

 And I said, “Well, that’s strange, because I am a singer and my name is Nick.”

 And she said, very slowly, “I know.”

 Then she said nothing for a while and my mind rushed all over the place, and I’m thinking, “Fuck, I’m sitting next to Nico. Fuck, I’m sitting next to Nico.”

 Eventually she said, “He died.”

 And I said, “Oh, you mean Nick Drake?”

 And she said, “Killed by his own hand.”

 And I said, “Well, that’s where we diverge.”

 She turned to me and after the longest time said, “Really? That’s what you think.”

 Then she stood up and in slow motion walked out of the room.

 And I’m thinking, “What the fuck.”

 Anyway, the photographer’s way of taking pictures was to have you look in a mirror, in this case, his bathroom mirror, and he would photograph your reflection. As I was arranging my face, there in the mirror, from the end of the hall behind me, Nico appeared, like an apparition, standing very still and looking into the mirror. The photographer took the photo and I said, “I want that one.”

 Sadly, I can’t remember what happened to the photos. I’m not sure I ever saw them. But, sitting here now and remembering, I sure would love that photograph.

 So, that was the day that Nico, who famously sang ‘I’ll be Your Mirror’, became ‘my mirror’, the day she wore green rubber wellington boots and moved very slowly, the day she prophesied wrongly my self-destruction, and the day she did in no way disappoint. I send the fullest version of my love to her, wherever she may be, and Nick Drake too, all of it.

Next Question

What’s the point?","Dear Laura and Andrew,

 ‘Oblivion’ is indeed a wonderful and essential poem.

  

 Oblivion

 It was a human face in my oblivion

 A human being and a human voice

 That cried to me, Come back, come back, come back.

 But I would not. I said I would not come back.

  

 It was so sweet in my oblivion

 There was a sweet mist wrapped me round about

 And I trod in a sweet and milky sea, knee deep,

 That was so pretty and so beautiful, growing deeper.

  

 But still the voice cried out, Come back, come back,

 Come back to me from sweet oblivion!

 It was a human and related voice

 That cried to me in pain. So I turned back.

  

 I cannot help but like Oblivion better

 Than being a human heart and human creature,

 But I can wait for her, her gentle mist

 And those sweet seas that deepen are my destiny

 And must come even if not soon.

  

 ————–

  

 I especially love the lines —

 ‘It was a human and related voice / That cried to me in pain. So I turned back.’

 To me, this goes some way toward explaining ‘the point’ — the point being our ‘relatedness’. The ‘sweet oblivion’ may be the solution to our separateness, but what calls the narrator to return from the ‘sweet and milky sea’ is the sublime but ordinary duty to our commonality and shared endeavour — life. 

 Oh, and check out ‘The Galloping Cat’. Strange, dark and simply amazing.

 With the passing of the years, that certain angle and certain light now elude me, and so your question, Steven, gave me a momentary spasm of manly vigour — I say ‘momentary’ as I soon realised that the idea I actually ‘pulled’ my wife couldn’t be further from the truth. In actual fact, she passed by me one evening, over twenty years ago, as I stood beneath my favourite dinosaur, Dippy the Diplodocus, in the main hall of London’s Natural History Museum and I was swept helplessly into the slipstream of her beauty, exterior and interior. I have been happily flailing about there ever since — not waving but drowning, as the great Stevie Smith would say; a poet, Tammy, I thoroughly recommend.

 Today, I asked my wife if she thought The Red Hand Files were a success. ‘Of course,’ she said, ‘they make you better.’ Jonathan, she is right. For me, The Red Hand Files are a spiritual practice, like church, like praying. They require that I spend a certain amount of time each week at the better, more compassionate end of my character. Over the three years that I have been answering your questions, the journey there has become easier and less resistant. I am getting better.

 Mostly though, I am awed by The Red Hand Files. Awe is the feeling we have when we encounter the monumental or immeasurable. We experience a sudden shrinking of the self, yet a rapid expansion of the soul. This is how I feel when I read the questions that come in each week. I am truly humbled by their vastness and raw honesty, and my soul grows large in amazement. You guys are the best.

Do you think it is more important to find inspiration or to get to work and write?

Next Question

What’s it like to write a song?","Dear Jake and Freya,

 I also have an affinity with artists who treat their craft as a job and are not dependent on the vagaries of inspiration — because I am one of them. Like most people with a job, we just go to work. It never occurs to us not to work, there is never a moment when we don’t work because ‘we are not feeling it’ or ‘the vibes aren’t right’. We just do our hours, as I am doing mine now, writing to you, Jake, and to you, Freya.

 The most important undertaking of my day is to simply sit down at my desk and pick up my pen. Without this elementary act I could not call myself a songwriter, because songs come to me in intimations too slight to be perceived, unless I am primed and ready to receive them. They come not with a fanfare, but in whispers, and they come only when I am at work. 

 Pen poised, I sit to attention, in my suit, on the edge of my imagination, prepared for the beautiful line to arrive. Sometimes it does, sometimes it does not — either way I am powerless to influence the outcome. So often we stand bereft before our ingenuity, with nothing to show for our efforts. Yet at other times we are ushered in.

 Once inside the imagination all manner of inexplicable things occur. Time gets loopy, the past presses itself against the present, and the future pours out its secrets. Suddenly words behave in ways they shouldn’t, but wonderfully do, our pulse quickens, yummy butterflies explode in our tummies and songwriting becomes a collision between the pragmatic and the completely gaga — transcendental, outrageously religious, bananas — and then God appears, there He is, with all His cross-dressing angels and demons and other things, I don’t even know what, spirits muttering unspeakable things, and chubby, pink muses tumbling about, and child-small shapes with outstretched arms, calling, instructing, and the beautiful line begins to take shape, gently emerging — there it is! — falling lovely from the end of your pen.

 And then your working day is done and you step away. It’s Saturday night and time for dinner and your rider’s name is Irfan. Goodnight, Jake. Goodnight, Freya.

Next Question

Would you tell us something about the song Carnage? Just some impressions. I can’t stop playing it.

Next Question

What is Carnage about? It is such a mysterious song. Can you tell us something? Anything?","Dear Peter, Eva, Karen and Signe,

 It is a little while since I have listened to the song ‘Carnage’, I will play it now and give you my own impressions, as they come.

 ***

  

 ‘I always seem to be saying goodbye / and rolling through the mountains like a train.’

  

 I am very happy with this opening line. I think it is the best I have written for some time. It lands us squarely in the centre of the song, emotionally, physically and poetically.

  

 ‘My uncle’s at the chopping block, turning chickens into fountains / I’m a barefoot child watching in the rain.’

  

 The song begins as a recollection (as does ‘Albuquerque’) with the initial act of carnage, a childhood memory of my uncle decapitating a chicken outside his country home in Mount Martha. I watched, in the rain, as a small, intrigued child.

 The chord shifts upwards, beautifully! Favourite moment on the album! (Thank you, Warren).

  

 ‘That stepped into this song / taken a bow / and stepped right out again.’

  

 The child enters the actual construction of the song, as an apparition, says goodbye, and then retreats as memories do.

 The song circles back to its opening chord as we move to the present time, the narrator sitting on the balcony reading — and writing the song, ‘Carnage’, itself.

  

 ‘I’m sitting on the balcony / reading Flannery O’Connor with a pencil and a plan.’

  

 I had just read an article that dealt with Flannery O’Connor’s unfortunate attitudes toward race, and her subsequent defenestration, and I am experiencing that particular conflicted sadness, so familiar these days, of watching someone I have loved for so long, and who has given so much to the world, driven to the margins by an unforgiving present, taking part of me with her. More carnage.

 Lovely half rhyme of ‘balcony’ and ‘Flannery’!

  

 ‘This song is like a rain cloud that keeps circling overhead / here it comes around again.‘

  

 The rain cloud is the chorus itself, waiting to burst, and as the chorus comes around, it begins to rain.

  

 ‘And it’s only love with a little bit of rain / and I hope to see you again.’

  

 ***

 Second verse and we are now launched into the future.

  

 ‘A rain deer frozen in the headlights steps back into the woods / my heart it is an open road where we ran away for good.‘

  

 The hero couple are on the road, buoyed away by the song, fleeing the past, the present, and journeying into an hallucinatory future, to spiritual love, to arrival, to death and transcendence.

 Lovely chordal rise (thank you again, Warren) that corresponds with the final ecstatic vision of the child, on fire, instated within the sun. I am very happy with that line too — the woman pointing to the shared vision.

  

 ‘Look over there! Look over there! / the sun a barefoot child with fire in his hair.‘

  

 And then the ecstatic detonation!

  

 ‘And then a sudden sun explodes!’

  

 And the muttered, secret words, as if to myself.

  

 ‘It was you, it was you, and only you.’

  

 The song rolls into the chorus and then returns to the opening sentiment, of love as the engine of all things, and life as a perpetual valediction, echoed later in ‘Lavender Fields’ and ‘Shattered Ground’.

 In the end the song ‘Carnage’ fulfils the promise of the first line, as it delivers itself from the carnage of the past and the carnage of the present, in the form of a conversion, to the peaceful fullness of time. It says goodbye.

  

 ‘And it’s only love / driving through the rain / rolling down the mountains / like a train / it’s only love / and it comes on like a train / rolling down the mountains / in the rain.’

  

 I hope these thoughts are of some value — not sure they have added anything — I hope they haven’t take too much away.

 I don’t have a particular problem with Charles Bukowski, other than I think his poetry sucks. He once said, poetry was “like taking a shit, you smell it and then flush it away … writing is all about leaving behind as much a stink as possible”, which is all very well, except I think he was applying this to all poetry when he should have been applying it to his own poetry exclusively. His poems are indeed do-do — silly shit — and cloyingly sentimental about his own place in a world he held in absolute contempt. His is a particular view of humanity as abjection which I find difficult to stomach, especially in poetry, beautiful poetry, lover of life and the world that I am.

 My advice to you is to grow a porn star moustache and learn the electric guitar — it worked for me — and try to hang in there until you’re sixty. Then you’ll find you don’t have to worry about what people say any more and, as a consequence, life becomes a whole lot more interesting.

 Entering your sixties brings with it a warm and fuzzy feeling of freedom through redundancy, through obsolescence, through living outside of the conversation and forever existing on the wrong end of the stick. What a relief it is to be that mad, embarrassing uncle in the corner of the room, a product of his age, with his loopy ideas about free speech and freedom of expression, with his love of beauty, of humour, chaos, provocation and outrage, of conversation and debate, his adoration of art without dogma, his impatience with the morally obvious, his belief in universal compassion, forgiveness and mercy, in nuance and the shadows, in neutrality and in humanity — ah, beautiful humanity — and in God too, who he thanks for letting him, in these dementing times, be old.

She lost her only child, Tristan, to a stroke, aged 49. We’re all consumed by sadness and mourn for the loss of her son, however hers is another thing altogether. She can’t bring herself to see anyone. I can’t reach her. Her laugh that brought smiles to all of us is gone. What can I do? What can I say? We all love her but feel so powerless. How can we start to bring our Aunt Marnie back?","Dear Ian,

 In my experience, there is a special place reserved for mothers who have lost their sons. Theirs is a singular and complex order of torture, unlike any other grief, and the fundamental need to lock oneself away from the world is natural, perhaps necessary. It is a form of self-imposed entombment, adjacent to eternity, where they can better be with the one they have lost. Aunt Marnie is spending time with the retreating image of her departed son and perhaps there is no room for you at this moment. Perhaps now is not the time she needs you, but you can be sure, in time, she will.

 I am reminded, yet again, of Mary Magdalene’s vigil at the mouth of Jesus’ tomb. After Jesus had been laid to rest, the stone had been rolled across the entrance of the cave, and the twelve apostles had fled, Mary Magdalene remained ‘standing there in front of the tomb.’ This silent, helpless vigil is, for me, the single most moving moment of the New Testament. This is where you stand now, Ian, having lost not only your cousin, but your beloved Aunt Marnie too.

 Eventually, your aunt will come back to you. It may be soon, or it may take some time. This feat will be achieved through astonishing courage and will most likely be tentative and gradual. She will look around to see who is there. Some may have drifted away, the reach of their compassion unable to match the magnitude of your aunt’s despair, but let me just say this—those who persisted, she will never forget, for to remain steadfast on the borders of another’s grief may be the greatest, most holy act of love one can perform. Be patient with Aunt Marnie.

 I read your question to Susie this morning. She sits in a stream of sunlight that pours through the window of our kitchen, her psychotic little dog, Nosferatu, on her lap.

 “All in good time,” she asked me to tell you.

 The person you think you used to be has gone, and is never coming back. The idealised impression of your past self that your present self competes with is a mirage. Every moment you live is a rapid and shocking abandonment of the last version of yourself. You are forever ‘straying from the person you used to be’. You are an autonomous entity coursing through time, moored only to the eternal now.

 We should not attempt to return to a past that no longer exists, or seize upon a future that is forever beyond our reach, but should instead travel along our own inner axes to a more meaningful part of our present selves.

 We may feel sadness for what we have lost to the past — our freedom, our vigour, our values, our playfulness, our openness to life — but regrets can be a wonderful indicator of how to improve the current condition of our souls. Rather than allowing these regrets to swallow us up, we can let them identify our present needs. We can call back these lost parts of ourselves and live them in a wiser, more experienced way, instead of wasting precious time in pointless competition with the past.

 This call to adventure can begin immediately, in the next moment. We can incrementally shift the direction of our impulses toward the next best thing, rather than the worst, and not become consumed by our regrets, but informed by them, as they guide us forward toward the more necessary part of our nature.

Next Question

What is your definition of hope?","Dear Shelly and Carlos,

 I don’t think we can separate the art from the artist, nor should we need to. I think we can look at a piece of art as the transformed or redeemed aspect of an artist, and marvel at the miraculous journey that the work of art has taken to arrive at the better part of the artist’s nature. Perhaps beauty can be measured by the distance it has travelled to come into being.

 That bad people make good art is a cause for hope. To be human is to transgress, of that we can be sure, yet we all have the opportunity for redemption, to rise above the more lamentable parts of our nature, to do good in spite of ourselves, to make beauty from the unbeautiful, and to have the courage to present our better selves to the world.

 The moon is high and yellow in the sky outside my window. It is a display of sublime beauty. It is also a cry for mercy — that this world is worth saving. Mostly, though, it is a defiant articulation of hope that, despite the state of the world, the moon continues to shine. Hope too resides in a gesture of kindness from one broken individual to another or, indeed, we can find it in a work of art that comes from the hand of a wrongdoer. These expressions of transcendence, of betterment, remind us that there is good in most things, rarely only evil. Once we awaken to this fact, we begin to see goodness everywhere, and this can go some way in setting right the current narrative that humans are shit and the world is fucked.

Thank you for sending her to me! I must say, it was a bit awkward at first; establishing a relationship with this new being of a kind that I had never known before. Especially because even though I could tell she was weak, I did not have any idea as to what she needed to feel well and safe. I was scared, for I did not want to make things worse. But strangely – although she never spoke to me with human words and thus far I don’t speak dragon – it seems like her needs, even her entire being, are directly on the surface! With every breath, through the ‘open-and-close’ movement of her scales, she communicates through the surface of her skin. It seems as if what she has to tell, thus travels through the air and into the pores of my own skin. And then I just know.

Anyway, I am so glad to have her with me and although in many ways she is still a mystery to me, there is so much in who she is that I find inspirational!

A trip to Croatia is nearing and I plan to take her with me. She seems to have gained quite some strength and I like to think that a change of environment may do her good. The village is quiet and surrounded by forests, mountains, streams and rivers and a lake, and she may even encounter some wildlife. I do have a good feeling about her meeting the kids, for they are still young enough to be able to tune in with her without too much distraction of self-reflection. What do you think? I am very sure it will do them good to meet a dragon.

Thanks again. If it wasn’t for you, I might have never noticed her when she passed me. So much that I would have missed.

All the best and we send you love","Dear Els,

 First let me enlighten those unfamiliar with my epic poem, The Sick Bag Song, that chronicles The Bad Seeds’ 2014 North American tour. In Edmonton, Alberta, I find, under a bridge by the mighty Saskatchewan River, a small, sick she-dragon. I carry her back to the hotel and attempt to revive her, but during the night the dragon dies. I dispose of her body the next morning, wrapping her in a blanket and dropping her over the Interstate Bridge, before heading across the border to Seattle. I thought that was the last I would see of her.

 Thus, I am delighted to read your letter, to find that the she-dragon was not dead after all and that she has found someone to take care of her. Yes, by all means introduce her to the kids, they are miraculously receptive to such things. Explain both what you have observed about her biology and her imaginary aspect — these two things are not incompatible. Remember, to beguile a child, in good faith, is always to be encouraged. Make sure they are gentle with the dragon though, she has travelled a great distance and has been through a considerable ordeal.

 I am genuinely touched that you have taken stewardship of her. I pray all my ideas are attended to with such care and devotion.

What is the value of suffering to us as individuals, and to us as a species as we go through our life carrying suffering around, like some mind-numbing, soul crushing weight?","Dear Peter,

 What do we do with suffering? As far as I can see, we have two choices—we either transform our suffering into something else, or we hold on to it, and eventually pass it on.

 In order to transform our pain, we must acknowledge that all people suffer. By understanding that suffering is the universal unifying force, we can see people more compassionately, and this goes some way toward helping us forgive the world and ourselves. By acting compassionately we reduce the world’s net suffering, and defiantly rehabilitate the world. It is an alchemical act that transforms pain into beauty. This is good. This is beautiful.

 To not transform our suffering and instead transmit our pain to others, in the form of abuse, torture, hatred, misanthropy, cynicism, blaming and victimhood, compounds the world’s suffering. Most sin is simply one person’s suffering passed on to another. This is not good. This is not beautiful.

 The utility of suffering, then, is the opportunity it affords us to become better human beings. It is the engine of our redemption.

Next Question

Please share a favourite memory of Anita with us.","Dear Matt, Helen and everyone who has written to me about Anita,

 You think you know grief, you think you’ve worked out its mechanics, you think you’ve become grief-savvy — stronger, wiser, more resilient — you think that there is nothing more that can hurt you in this world, and then Anita dies.

 Standing on the street in a baby-doll dress, surrounded by sunshine, laughing and radiating a piercing beauty of such force you stop breathing.

 I could not believe my eyes.

 Later, at my kitchen table drawing things, she had a quickness of touch and a clear, light line full of humour, throwing each drawing away and starting another, charged with a rampant, unstable, fatal energy that would follow her all her life. My line, amateur and ponderous.

 Everyone wanted to work with her but it was like trying to trap lightning in a bottle. Mick Harvey managed to corral her into the recording studio, but these precious offerings are a fraction of what she was.

 She was the smartest and most talented of all of us, by far.

 Walked into the most prestigious art college in Australia — on a whim — and talked her way into being given a place there. Bought an easel, some butcher’s paper, some crayons, put on a dress, did her hair and never went back in.

 She thought the best ideas were the ones that never saw the light of day.

 She was the brains behind The Birthday Party, wrote a bunch of their songs, wrote ‘From Her to Eternity’, ‘The World’s a Girl’, ’Sugar in a Hurricane’ and my favourite Bad Seeds song, ‘Stranger Than Kindness’, but was much more than that.

 How could something so luminous carry so much darkness?

 Drank gin out of a baby’s bottle.

 Despised the concept of the muse but was everybody’s.

 Spoke in a child’s voice and was my best friend.

 Two months ago, speaking to her on the phone she seemed a million miles away.

 Loved her children more than anything. They were her pride and joy.

 It was both easy and terrifying to love her.

 Leaves a big, crying space.

 Yes, I did step into the Vortex today and I’m blown away by the new videos that have been made. The version of ‘The Jam’ is an extraordinarily complex achievement, ‘Steve McQueen’ is deeply and humanly moving, and the videos for the ‘Carnage’ songs are a beautiful act of rescue. I loved the haikus, and the very sweet kiddie’s graphic escapade of ‘Balcony Man’. The already deeply worrying ‘Kitchenette’ has been made even more deeply worrying, and the version of ‘Vortex’ is gorgeous. As far as I’m concerned, all are advancements on the originals.

Do you ever suffer from self-doubt?

A girl was falling in love with me, and while she courted me, she shared a part of herself which was you. I had never heard your music before, and it struck me that you were like me – you and I were born within a 100km radius of one another. The young girl who loved me shared with me friendship, forgiveness, and a figure of alien greatness who at one time came from some place around here.

I now have two young sons Max and Joey. They enjoy listening to your music, they dance around the living room. Joey is an emotional lightning rod who feels the world more intensely than anyone I have ever met. Little Max cannot speak yet, but he sings, and when he smiles you can see clear through into his soul. One day when they are old enough to really understand, I will tell them that you came from here. I will tell them that they can aspire to be more than a person from a place, and maybe they will not end up like their father.","Dear Thomas,

 You sent this letter some time ago and I keep coming back to it, responding to its wonderfully precise and tender heart. I’ve read it to several people, including film director and friend, Andrew Dominik, who basically cried, as did my normally steely assistant, Rachel. It reads like a Raymond Carver story — lean and lovely and sad — a world in every line. I have received and read around forty thousand letters on The Red Hand Files and yours is perhaps my favourite. I am very happy that this letter was written by a guy from my hometown of Melbourne — that makes me proud.

 Do I ever feel self-doubt? The answer is yes, very much so. My self-doubt tends to manifest itself in sudden, hot rushes of embarrassment, and usually emerges alongside a loss of playfulness or humour — or rather, when I start to take myself, and indeed life, too seriously. It seems to arise as a countering response to my own sense of self-importance. Self-doubt is common to us all, I suspect, and uncomfortable and unpleasant as it is, a certain amount can be the truest humanising force, keeping us humble, vulnerable, open-minded and connected to the world. But, of course, we need to remain vigilant and not allow our self-doubt to become compulsive — to imprison us, shut us down and make us incapable of forward movement. At these times, it is worth remembering that the world can be funny — as can we — and to not take ourselves too seriously.

 But, Thomas, the main reason I am writing to you is to just say thank you for your letter, it is a superb thing, really, and something I will treasure. When I read it to Susie this morning she said, ‘What a lovely man.’ ‘Yeah, I know,’ I said ‘He’s from Melbourne.’

I am curious to know which poems in this volume are your favourites. I would toss John Donne out for a bit of John Berryman any day.

Next Question

I want to try and read more poetry but I really don’t know where to start. Can you suggest any poets I could read to get me going?

Next Question

Got any Warren stories?","One summer day in 1996, Warren and I, and our friend Tara-Jane, decided to hire a little boat and row out on the Serpentine in Hyde Park. It was a glorious, sunny day and as I reclined at one end of the boat and Warren sat precariously up front, Tara-Jane happily rowed. In the middle of the lake Tara-Jane put the oars away and we floated among the ducks. Suddenly and without warning, from there upon the bow, Warren began to recite from memory, ‘The Flea’ by John Donne. I was very impressed by this because it’s a pretty long poem, and we were both unbelievably stoned. After a while I sort of drifted off. When I awoke, Tara-Jane was asleep, the ducks and sun had gone, and Warren was still reciting ‘The Flea’ by John Donne, which says a lot about my friend’s incredible stamina and his indefatigable ability to be forever on transmit. It was a lovely day.

 As a consequence, I have a soft spot for John Donne, as I do for Camille Paglia’s dazzling ‘Break, Blow, Burn’. Camille does a deep and passionate dive into her favourite poems, including ‘The Flea’ and a hair-raisingly scandalous analysis of John Donne’s ‘Holy Sonnet XIV’.

 David, Camille Paglia explains in the foreword why she has included only English language poems — the very real problem of translation, and because of her beautifully articulated love of the English language. Half the poems in ‘Break, Blow, Burn’ are in fact twentieth century poems. But you are right, there is never enough of the great John Berryman.

 For me, it matters little whether I like the poems Camille Paglia has chosen for ‘Break, Blow, Burn’ or not. Her deep readings are so meticulously and uniquely rendered, they become small but profound lessons in how to love poetry as she examines just what lives inside a good poem. The book is a much-needed defence of beauty itself and, Angela, a glorious place to begin a relationship with that most bountiful of art forms, poetry.

I am twenty-five and feel ancient. I can’t imagine what it’s like for you. What is it like?","Dear Sarah and Chaz,

 Some things I have written during lockdown refused to shape themselves into song lyrics and so have remained resolutely on the page. These I call poems, but this may be a category error and they are, in fact, just failed songs. Not all of them are quite as self-absorbed as this ‘poem’ but, Chaz, The Spanish Lady does seem to answer your question.

 The line ‘a Spanish lady washing her feet by candlelight’ comes from an Irish-American folk song called The Spanish Lady, and ‘I walk with sweet Sally hand upon hand’ comes from my own song, Loom of the Land.

  

 All my songs are waving goodbye

 They are trailing behind them a smear of rage

 I am thinking with the mind of someone twice my age

 I’m an all-singing, all-dancing thing that died

 And nothing but nothing is going as planned

 As I walked with sweet Sally, hand upon hand

  

 I wanted to write up but could only write down

 With my hunter dogs I walk round town

 I’m swallowed by the city and lose my way

 And pass by a window and suddenly see

 A Spanish lady washing her feet by candlelight

  

 And this was absolutely not part of the plan

 But I’m suddenly alive and half my age

 An all-singing, all-dancing horror on stage

 Who never wanted for nothing, just a little bit more

 As my dogs devour me to a hashtag of gore

 I wanted to write less but could only write more

  

 This song is waving to you with its busted crutch

 I am lost and tired and completely out of touch

 But I am something, I guess, that just keeps going on

 As I walk with sweet Sally, song upon song

Next Question

Any plans for Carnage?","Dear David and Lisa,

 The main reason Warren and I went into the studio was not to make a record. I think, more than anything, we just wanted to spend some time together. It had been a long time since we had seen each other and we were eager to continue the musical conversation we’d been having all these years. So, we met at the studio, greeted each other, and began.

 To be honest, I don’t really remember what we did in those first couple of days – we just played and played in a kind of fogged fury, each paying witness to the stir-crazy other, and allowing our music to do its thing, advancing us toward our better selves. At least, it seemed that way. Music can do that. Make you better.

 Warren texted me a couple of days later.

  

 “Have you listened to this stuff?” he asked.

  

 I had been busy writing Red Hand Files or drawing frogs or being a ceramicist or choosing fabric for The Vampire’s Wife or writing poetry or meditating or something, and said I hadn’t.

  

 “I’ll send you the hits,” he said. “Prepare to be amazed.”

  

 Warren sent me what constituted, as if by magic, a fully formed album.

  

 I texted back, “Call it Carnage.”

  

 ***

  

 I think it was one of the popes who, when asked how long he prayed each day, replied, “About ten minutes, but I spend all day thinking about it”. So it was with Carnage. I had been sitting at my desk — suddenly and shockingly not travelling — writing lyrics and poems into a void, with no real objective other than to make sense of this stationary moment. The world felt weird. My body felt weird. I had been jet-lagged for forty-five years. Now my inner clock had begun to tick regularly. Some nights I even slept. I think Warren’s experience was not dissimilar. I think we both felt the enforced stasis, not just unnerving, but also strangely and fitfully energizing, and so, when we began working in the studio, Carnage came out fast and necessary, as proof of life.

 Now, our friend, Andrew Dominik, the movie director, has come to London to film Warren and me attempting to play Carnage (and Ghosteen) live. Five years have passed since Andrew made ‘One More Time with Feeling’. Much has changed. But some things haven’t. The world still turns, ever perilous, but containing its many joys. Music remains a balm. Friendships endure. This letter is fractured. I am so excited to perform.

Next Question

I want to do music and I love it so much. It means everything to me but I worry that I don’t have any talent. How important is talent?","Dear Paula and Stella,

 In Melbourne, in the late seventies, there was a beautiful blossoming of creativity, and the music scene was awash with talented people. Brilliant musicians, some of them extraordinarily accomplished, were everywhere. You couldn’t walk through St Kilda or Carlton waving a stick without hitting a talented musician. I was one of those talented people — I just wasn’t that talented. I couldn’t play an instrument as well as most other musicians, I was a less than capable singer, and my songwriting was in no way as strong as that of some of my contemporaries. I was acutely aware of these shortcomings, and felt set apart from that world.

 Having said that, I was also aware that there was a force at work inside of me that other musicians didn’t seem to possess, at least not to the same degree. This also set me apart, and caused me no end of trouble. I had, without any supporting evidence, a shameless and pathological belief in my own awesomeness. Whilst many other musicians’ dreams seem to stretch to getting a gig at the local pub on a Saturday night, my dream was always, always, world domination. You have to remember that this is coming from a guy who when asked by his primary school teacher what he wanted to be when he grew up, answered, ‘A cult leader.’

 Now this may sound unattractive, and it was, but that’s what my youthfulness was like — an energetic and aspirational collision of the beautiful and the deeply unpleasant, with an emphasis on the latter. As a young person I harnessed the unredeemed aspects of my personality — rage, vengeance, power, self-absorption, rampant ambition — to provide the energy to move beyond my lack of aptitude.

 This furious motion kept me running wild through the years, until I finally collided with myself, I guess, and things changed. But that’s another story. This is just to say to you both — any competency I display now, such as the ability to write, record or perform songs, came about through repetition and practise and a bloody-minded pursuit of my own particular vision. Nothing came naturally. I worked at it.

 Art gives much, but it asks much in return. It demands nothing less than complete commitment and significant sacrifice. Talent is nice if you have it, but in some ways it is a secondary requirement. Warren Ellis once said, ‘Proceed with absolute confidence,’ and, Stella, that is my advice to you. Find your authentic voice and push violently and defiantly against your limitations — and you never know, great things may happen. I hope they do.

Next Question

Who is Thomas H? The song White Elephant is dedicated to?","Dear Yvonne and Brendan,

 The song ‘White Elephant’ is dedicated to the British sculptor and painter, Thomas Houseago. I met Thomas in Los Angeles around the time of the release of Ghosteen — a record Thomas loved — and we became very close friends. I would visit his massive studio in Frogtown, where he worked on his giant sculptures and dark traumatic paintings, violent amplifications of his beautiful but troubled soul.

 At the beginning of this year, just prior to the pandemic, Thomas dropped off the map. I was back in Brighton by then, and his sudden disappearance was very worrying. He eventually got in touch some months later — he told me he’d had a breakdown, but with help from various people in LA he had begun the process of putting himself back together. He said that he was currently in Malibu recovering. He seemed subdued, he said that he was doing okay but could no longer find it in himself to make art.

 It was at a time when I was having difficulty getting the lyrics together for the record that would become Carnage. I had been sitting on my balcony in Brighton, with the world going to hell, and nothing in my head but a whole lot of dread and uncertainty. And so, over the phone, I made a deal with Thomas — if he painted me a picture, I would write him a song. I felt that this challenge might give him the impetus to create something — I have found that sometimes it can be helpful to remove oneself from the creative process, and do work in the service of others. I personally felt I could write a song for my friend Thomas, even if I couldn’t write one for myself.

 That night I wrote ‘White Elephant’ and sent it to him. The lyric came hard and fast, in a single sitting, which is very unusual for me. At the same time Thomas painted a picture, which he sent to me (to date it has not arrived and remains, sadly, stuck in customs somewhere.)

 ‘White Elephant’ would kick-start a period of intense lyric writing for me that would culminate in Carnage. Thomas claims that the painting he did for me broke him open and got him working again. He has since gone on to create the most extraordinary series of what he calls ‘Vision Paintings’ — massive, ecstatic, confronting, God-soaked paintings — and in my opinion his truest, bravest work.

 We are, Thomas and I, indebted to one another, like friends often are. Occasionally he FaceTimes me, standing, roaring and laughing, in front of his enormous sun-blasted canvasses, created on his patio in Malibu, overlooking the sea. They are mighty, defiant and subversive works, a testament to one man’s struggle with his own destructive energies and the miraculous healing power of art.

What does Christ mean to you? I hear his name mentioned in many of your songs, but thematically there is some ambiguity. Do you consider yourself a Christian?","Dear Ellery,

 You are right to say that there is some ambiguity to my relationship with Christ, and I don’t consider myself a Christian — at least ‘most of time’, as Bob Dylan would say. Spiritual matters for me are always evolving, never static, and are energised by their mystery and uncertainty and attendant struggle.

 However, this much I think is true. I believe that there is a unifying essentialness within all people — the spirit, the soul — and that this spirit is innocent and good and connected to the divine. Over that essential spirit of goodness we place, throughout our lives, mechanisms, strategies, agendas, defences, transgressions — layers of behaviour that collect and deepen, like Philip Larkin’s ‘coastal shelf’, and engulf that core of goodness, separating us from the divine nature of the world. Although I believe this, I find it extremely difficult to actually connect deeply with these invisible notions — the spirit and the soul.

 Personally, I need to see the world through metaphors, symbols and images. It is through images that I can engage meaningfully with the world. The personalising of this invisible notion of the spirit is necessary for me to fully understand it. I find that using the word ‘Christ’ as the actualising symbol of the eternal goodness in all things extremely useful. The Christ in everything makes sense to me — I can see it — and helps me to act more compassionately within the world.

 It feels to me that sometimes we practise a kind of conditional compassion and reserve our goodwill to those we think deserve it. To practise a form of universal compassion, I find it of considerable value to remember that our love is a lifeline thrown to that pure essentialness, the Christ deep within us, entombed, suffering and yearning for our assistance.

 Acts of compassion, kindness and forgiveness can ignite this spirit of goodness within each other and within the world. Small acts of love reach down and bring succour to that animated spirit, the beseeching Christ, so in need of rehabilitation.

I listened to that record repeatedly as a lonely, bullied and suicidal 12-year-old girl and I think I took it as some kind of a fantasy of love and all the sweet, horrible pain and adventure it would bring.

I remember around that time watching an interview where you said you felt somewhat ‘disgusted’ by certain elements of that record. I could not possibly understand what you meant by it back then.

Now, 20 years later, I have experienced love, pain and adventure. Listening to your Alexandria Palace versions of those songs, they are not a fantasy to me anymore. They are as real as I am in my attempts at living.

What were you disgusted by back then? What do those songs mean to you now and what made you revisit them?

I wish you could have seen me as a 12-year-old trying to figure out what ‘an interventionist God’ means. Thank you for bringing so much light into my life.","Dear Elina,

 The Boatman’s Call was a record born of a personal misfortune that led to a departure from fictitious narrative songwriting into a kind of writing that was more autobiographical. Artistically, my hand was forced by a convergence of events that felt so calamitous at the time that I could not find a way to write about anything else. It’s not that I had any desire to write a ‘break-up record’, but these events just rammed the ramparts of my songwriting and seized control.

 After The Boatman’s Call came out I experienced a kind of embarrassment. I felt I had exposed too much. These hyper-personal songs suddenly seemed indulgent, self-serving amplifications of what was essentially an ordinary, commonplace ordeal. All the high drama, the tragedy and the hand wringing ‘disgusted’ me, and I said so in press interviews.

 In time, however, I learned that the disgust was essentially the fear and shame experienced by someone who was swimming the uncertain waters between two boats — songs that were fictional and songs of an autobiographical or confessional nature. A radical change was occurring in my songwriting, despite myself, and such changes can leave one feeling extremely vulnerable, defensive and reactive.

 Of course, I no longer see The Boatman’s Call in that way, and understand that the record was a necessary leap into a type of songwriting that would ultimately become exclusively autobiographical — Skeleton Tree and Ghosteen, for example — but, conversely, less about myself and more about our collective ‘selves’. When I sang the The Boatman’s Call songs for the Idiot Prayer film, they no longer felt like cries emanating from the small, yet cataclysmic, devastations of life. They became more about a spiritual liberation from the self, about something broader and more comprehensive — not transcendent exactly — but expansive, in that they collected us all up in the commonality of the experience they attempt to describe. At least, I hoped so.

 Thank you, Elina, for your very sweet story. Funnily enough, I am still trying to work out what the first line of Into My Arms actually means. It’s a slippery fish and — like many good lines — difficult to hang onto, as elusive and deceptive as time itself.

Next Question

Is shitty art worth making?","Dear Tom and Leah,

 The Bible opens with the story of the creation —

 In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.

 The story tells us that God thought His creation to be ‘very good’. I have to say, I very much agree — the world is not only very good, it is perfect — so wholly perfect that it has the capacity to hold within it profoundly imperfect things. It is a masterpiece folded around an essential and energising flaw — our humanity.

 As for shitty art, all art is perfectly imperfect — like the world itself — and to some extent value judgments on art are largely subjective and beside the point. Creating art is about growing the world and increasing its reach, and it has more to do with the act of creation itself than what is actually made. Anything that animates us creatively in a positive way — be it the grand design of a great architectural wonder or the Big Bang of a child’s drawing — is a re-enactment of the original creation story. Whether we realise it or not, making art is a religious encounter as it is our attempts to grow beyond ourselves that energise the soul of the universe.

 I’m just walking back from work, thinking about your questions. It is late and the night is dark and wet and the deserted streets shimmer in the rain. Saint Mary Abbots rises up before me, empty and eerie, its floodlit spire reaching into the sky. There is an insistent and loving space between all things and it is suddenly a perfect moment — a perfect moment nested in a shared human catastrophe — but perfect all the same.

130,January 2021,https://www.theredhandfiles.com/written-something-worthwhile,written-something-worthwhile,1,GORAN,LLUBLJANA,SLOVENIA,How do you know when you have written something worthwhile? What is your process?,"Dear Goran,

 In Issue #87 I wrote about my favourite line from the New Testament —

 “Mary Magdalene and the other Mary remained standing there in front of the tomb.”

 To me, this line seems to sum up, among other things, the process of songwriting. William Blake said ‘Jesus is the imagination’ and these words have always resonated with me. They have bound together the notion of Jesus and the creative act, and lifted it into the supernatural sphere.

 A large part of the process of songwriting is spent waiting in a state of attention before the unknown. We stand in vigil, waiting for Jesus to emerge from the tomb — the divine idea, the beautiful idea — and reveal Himself.

 Often, the beautiful idea that has formed is at first unrecognisable to us. We don’t see it for what it is, because it is new and implausible. Just as Mary Magdalene does not recognise Jesus when He first appears to her outside the tomb, the beautiful idea may emerge dimly and appear peculiar to us, not announcing itself but standing, half hidden and improbable, in the shadows.

 So, we continue to wait. But while we wait we must remain prepared and alert, and one way to do so is to write things down, in order to advance the idea, as this indicates a readiness to receive. Beware, however, of the idea that comes too easily, as this is often a residual idea and only compelling because it reminds us of something we have already done. We don’t want an idea that is like something we have done before. We don’t want a second-hand idea. We want the new idea. We want the beautiful idea.

 One day, you will write a line that feels wrong, but at the same time provides you with a jolt of dissonance, a quickening of the nervous system. You will shake your head and write on, only to find that you come back to it, shake your head again, and carry on writing — yet back you come, again and again. This is the idea to pay attention to, the difficult idea, the disturbing idea, shimmering softly among all the deficient, dead ideas, gently but persistently tugging at your sleeve — the Jesus idea.

129,January 2021,https://www.theredhandfiles.com/how-is-your-lockdown,how-is-your-lockdown,1,TOBIAS,LONDON,UK,How is your lockdown?,"Dear Tobias,

 In many ways lockdown has felt weirdly familiar, like I’ve experienced it before. I guess this should come as no surprise as I was a heroin addict for many years and self-isolating and social distancing were the name of the game. I am also well acquainted with the mechanics of grief — collective grief works in an eerily similar way to personal grief, with its dark confusion, deep uncertainty and loss of control. For me, lockdown feels like a state mandated version of more of the same — a formalisation of the kind of hermit-like behaviour to which I’ve always been predisposed, and so, as difficult as it has been to see the devastation and anguish caused by the pandemic — including to the lives of those close to me, and many who have written into The Red Hand Files — I have been doing okay.

 I am surprised, though, at just how hard not being able to play live has felt. I have come to the conclusion that I am essentially a thing that tours. There is a terrible yearning and a feeling of a life being half-lived. I miss the thrill of stepping onto the stage, the rush of the performance, where all other concerns dissolve into a pure animal interrelation with my audience. I miss the complete surrender to the moment, the loss of self, the physicalness of it all, the feeding frenzy of communal love, the religion, the glorious exchange of bodily fluids — and The Bad Seeds themselves, of course, in all their reckless splendour, how I miss them. As much as sitting behind my desk can bring me a lot of joy, and the imagination can be a stimulating, even dangerous place, I long for the wanton abandon of the live performance.

 Anyway, as promised in my last issue, I did go into the studio — with Warren — to make a record.

 It’s called CARNAGE.

 When the pandemic first hit and we had to postpone the European tour I was given the opportunity to take stock, and to see what I actually wanted to do with my life. Well, I took stock. I took a year’s stock. I came to the conclusion that what I most wanted to do in life was to play live. I truly miss it. Cancelling the tour is a great disappointment to me, and to the rest of the band. We tried to make it work but, in the end, with so many things about 2021 remaining unpredictable, including no certainty on whether we would be able to deliver the large scale arena show that we wanted to — and in the way that we wanted to — we felt we had to make the decision to cancel, at least for now. I try to keep The Red Hand Files as measured as possible, as a matter of principle, but whichever way you look at it, this sucks.

 Time to make a record.

Next Question

What is your view on the BBC ‘amendments’ to Fairytale of New York?","Dear Joseph and Roy,

 Truly great songs that are as emotionally powerful as Fairytale of New York are very rare indeed. Fairytale is a lyrical high wire act of dizzying scope and potency, and it rightly takes its place as the greatest Christmas song ever written. It stands shoulder to shoulder with any great song, from any time, not just for its sheer audacity, or its deep empathy, but for its astonishing technical brilliance.

 One of the many reasons this song is so loved is that, beyond almost any other song I can think of, it speaks with such profound compassion to the marginalised and the dispossessed. With one of the greatest opening lines ever written, the lyrics and the vocal performance emanate from deep inside the lived experience itself, existing within the very bones of the song. It never looks down on its protagonists. It does not patronise, but speaks its truth, clear and unadorned. It is a magnificent gift to the outcast, the unlucky and the broken-hearted. We empathise with the plight of the two fractious characters, who live their lonely, desperate lives against all that Christmas promises — home and hearth, cheer, bounty and goodwill. It is as real a piece of lyric writing as I have ever heard, and I have always felt it a great privilege to be close friends with its creator, Shane MacGowan.

 Now, once again, Fairytale is under attack. The idea that a word, or a line, in a song can simply be changed for another and not do it significant damage is a notion that can only be upheld by those that know nothing about the fragile nature of songwriting. The changing of the word ‘faggot’ for the nonsense word ‘haggard’ destroys the song by deflating it right at its essential and most reckless moment, stripping it of its value. It becomes a song that has been tampered with, compromised, tamed, and neutered and can no longer be called a great song. It is a song that has lost its truth, its honour and integrity — a song that has knelt down and allowed the BBC to do its grim and sticky business.

 I am in no position to comment on how offensive the word ‘faggot’ is to some people, particularly to the young — it may be deeply offensive, I don’t know, in which case Radio 1 should have made the decision to simply ban the song, and allow it to retain its outlaw spirit and its dignity.

 In the end, I feel sorry for Fairytale, a song so gloriously problematic, as great works of art so often are, performed by one of the most scurrilous and seditious bands of our time, whose best shows were so completely and triumphantly out of order, they had to be seen to believed.

 Yet, time and time again the integrity of this magnificent song is tested. The BBC, that gatekeeper of our brittle sensibilities, forever acting in our best interests, continue to mutilate an artefact of immense cultural value and in doing so takes something from us this Christmas, impossible to measure or replace. On and on it goes, and we are all the less for it.

126,November 2020,https://www.theredhandfiles.com/hard-sometimes-to-keep-going,hard-sometimes-to-keep-going,1,MATTI,STOCKHOLM,SWEDEN,Hey first I wanna say really like your music i have lost my beautiful wife in cancer and my dear brother in covid 19 my question to you is how keep you going on after lost your son its hard sometimes to keep going on with life.,"Dear Matti,

 There is little to say to someone who has lost a loved one that is of itself any real help. That has been my experience. Language falls short before the immensity of the experience of grief. There are simply not the words. My well-meaning and desperately worried friends would speak into my grief, using words that made no sense. They would tell me that my son lived in my heart, for example, but I genuinely did not understand these words because when I searched my heart I found nothing but chaos and despair.

 One desperate morning, however, I did the most simple of things and perhaps this can help you with the loss of your wife, and your brother, more than my words. I sat by myself, in a quiet space, and called upon my son by name. I closed my eyes and imagined lifting him from my heart — this tormented place in which I was told he lived — and I positioned him outside of my body, next to me, beside me. I said, “You are my son and now you are beside me.” These few words had a powerful, vibrational effect, and this simple act of imagination was the first step in a process that would eventually lead me back to the world. By performing this act I was temporarily released from the rational world, a merciless place that gave me no peace, and given access to an impossible realm where I could form an increasingly resolute relationship with the spiritual idea of my lost child.

 I began to feel Arthur’s presence. I talked to him. He talked to me. I took him with me wherever I went. I toured Europe and America with the ‘In Conversations’ show and he sat with me in my dressing room, or later at night in my hotel, or he escorted me onto stage and stood there beside me. I felt emboldened by his constructed presence, or perhaps true presence — who knows? What did it matter? I felt increasingly empowered, unafraid, as I allowed him to accompany me out of my boundless grief. Sometimes, on stage, I would look out at the audience and feel a collective spiritual influence attending to everyone. It was a deeply powerful experience and testament to the restorative force of our imaginings — that child of God, that divine invention — rescuing me from my catastrophic heart and in doing so freeing himself from the convulsion of my grief.

 Matti, forgive me if this makes no sense to you, but perhaps there is a way to summon your wife and dear brother and release them from your despair so that they can attend to you — allow them to become your spiritual companions in that impossible realm, to look after you in their imagined presence, and guide you forward until things get better. For they do, in time, they do.

 John Cooper Clarke is a very funny man. I used to see him around back in the day, and I think we probably both had the same fondness for dangerous things — drugs and humour.

 Just so that everyone knows what we are talking about, The Hyatt Girls are a group of beautiful and very naked women who live in my imagination and perform pornographic acts with each other, provided I stay at a Hyatt Hotel. For years I have drawn them, to the best of my ability, on the hotel’s notepaper whenever I have stayed at a Hyatt. I have now turned these drawings into erotic wallpaper, which I sell at great expense on my lovely, contentious Cave Things online shop.

 There are also other groups of women — The Hilton Girls and The Ritz Carlton Girls, for example — residing in my imagination who will perform pornographic acts on condition that I stay at the applicable hotels. As with The Hyatt Girls, in order to remember them, I sketch them on the hotel notepaper. I’ll be turning these into wallpaper too at some point — once I get my shit together.

 And then there are The Travelodge Girls — they perform particularly enthusiastic pornographic acts in my imagination, but because Travelodge doesn’t supply any notepaper I haven’t been able to draw them. If Travelodge had their own notepaper, I could think of the girls, draw them, and make The Travelodge Girls wallpaper, which I can sell at a more affordable price than The Hyatt Girls wallpaper — which is so bloody expensive nobody in their right mind buys it.

 I hope this answers your question. Our minds are mysterious places where wild chimeras play — but it should be said that, for me, none exist that are not silenced by the wakening of my wife, here she comes now, rising beautiful, dreamy, body and soul, my love, my darling, in the early golden light — good morning.

 Look around you.

 If you turn and veer onto a different path, even though these people who all think the same thoughts, and say the same things, and behave the same way, may look at you, and may scoff at you and may even threaten you, carry on — as uncertain and crooked as the path may be. Keep moving, because though this path may not be the easiest path, or even the best path, it will be the most interesting, the most instructive, even the most enlightened path. It is your path, where you get to be who you want to be, say what you want to say, and love what you want to love — your path — and you can take much comfort from that, because you may be the one who shudders, you may be the one who spins and glows, you may be the one who shines, you may even be the one who bursts into flames, but even still, there you are and all along you go — your path, your path.

 The letters sent to The Red Hand Files are mostly beautiful, full of love and a joy to read, but I do get the odd unkind message. Generally, though, I like them and find them weirdly energising. There is nothing quite like a good death threat in the morning to get the juices flowing. They are a form of validation, really, as no one with a public platform and an opinion is doing his or her job effectively if they are not being attacked from time to time.

 Having said that, Pat, when you say that we are living in a ‘time of cynicism and cruelty’, I am not sure I agree with you. I think we are living through a frightening and deeply uncertain time, and though there are dementing and cynical voices out there, which are being emboldened and amplified by social media — that loony engine of outrage — they do not represent the voices of the many, or the good. My experience of actual people in this time is overwhelmingly positive — there is a great deal of love and mutual regard and community. I think most of us understand that in order to rise above this particular moment we must pull together, and act with civility, generosity and kindness. We have a monumental task ahead of us that will require vast reserves of energy — we must rehabilitate the world — and this fellow feeling and mutual respect is essential to the process.

 Of course, there is much in our world that is in need of change, to be set to rights, and clearly humanity is complex, conflicted and full of faults, but at this moment in time, when our very existence hangs in the balance, we need to come together not just in good faith and consolation, but also in a spirit of creativity and invention. Our existence depends upon offering the best of ourselves. Negativity, cynicism and resentment will not do. ‘We must love one another or die.’

Finally, and this is what resonated with me the most, you stated that you could not get much substance out of living a life which was content. Do you still believe that?
A sincere and devoted admirer of yours who sort of struggles in a content life.","Dear Hyun,

 One of the truly humbling aspects of The Red Hand Files is the glimpse it has given me into the vast and varied sweep of human suffering. Letter after letter comes in, day after day, increasingly so during the pandemic and its recurring lockdowns, from people suffering distress due to very serious problems — mental health issues, loneliness, homelessness, physical and mental abuse, loss of jobs, loss of loved ones, loss of dreams, loss of meaning and loss of hope. It is a profound privilege to read these letters as it puts one’s own struggles into perspective, and is a reminder that despite our differences, no one is immune to suffering.

 So, when I read the quote from a younger Nick Cave saying he needs catastrophes in his life to create, these words sound somewhat like the indulgent posturing of a man yet to discover the devastating effect true suffering can have on our ability to function, let alone to create. I am not only talking about personal grief, but also global grief, as the world is plunged deeper into this wretched pandemic. The pandemic is playing havoc with our lives – but so is the questionable response of the lockdowns. The letters I receive through The Red Hand Files are testament to the devastating and largely ignored effect of lockdowns, not just on the economy, but on the very soul of the world. From reading the data — and I say this with great caution — one can’t help but wonder if the collateral damage from the lockdowns, this closeting of our lives, will end up outweighing the benefits. 

 Hyun, if you are living a life that is content my advice is to learn to live inside it, examine it, relish it, and most of all remember it — this extraordinary thing, a happy life — because there may come a time when something will present itself in the form of a misfortune, a transgression, an abuse, a failure, a humiliation, a loss, or, indeed, a global crisis where your life will turn, in an instant, from easy comfort to total chaos. It is happening all around us.

 On one level, some of this incoming despair is the routine devastation of ordinary life — suffering is always with us. Still, I pray that, ultimately, we will step beyond this extraordinary harrowing of our time to a new way, a different way, a better way. I hope we will be afforded that opportunity.

As a recovering heroin addict, I am having difficulty getting into the Narcotics Anonymous scene. I see how it can help but I feel as if many people replaced doing drugs with talking about when they used to do drugs. I am trying to find a good support system but it is hard. Perhaps I am being too cynical and not giving it a chance? Do you have any more advice for a recovering heroin user?","Dear Evan,

 Personally, I have a lot of time for Narcotics Anonymous, but I do understand your resistance to the idea. I was the same. In my heart I never really got it — never felt the same connection other people seemed to have. I always felt outside the idea, looking in. I could never fully commit.

 However, I think it would be fair to say if it weren’t for NA I probably wouldn’t have survived my heroin addiction. Narcotics Anonymous was this thing, steady and ever-present, that just never ever went away, a place I could come crawling back to, again and again, year after year, and be accepted and welcomed, welcomed back in. In this respect I owe Narcotics Anonymous my life. When no one else would have me, Narcotics Anonymous always would.

 The basis of Narcotics Anonymous, the Twelve Steps, a series of suggestions as to how to live a life — the original ‘antidote to chaos’ — seems to me to be an extraordinarily effective way to navigate the world, for all people, addicts or otherwise. Having said that, I do not follow The Twelve Steps myself, to my detriment I would say. Doubtless, I would be a better person if I did.

 In the end you find your own way. Ultimately I found mine outside of NA, with my wife, but it took Narcotics Anonymous to show me the way.

In June one of my best friends suddenly died aged 46. He was a sailing buddy for about 20 years, since I was 18. We have sailed up and down the Aegean Sea for thousands of miles. We had booked a sailing yacht for the whole of August, just the two of us, to go sailing in the deserted – due to Covid – Aegean. He was getting married in September, and this was meant to be our own, peculiar, spiritual, bachelor party. We would take with us our music, our books and our drugs. And we would sail where the wind took us. When August came, I decided to go ahead with the journey on my own. I nailed a picture of him, Fotis, on the cockpit and begun alone, though many friends wanted to come along. But I wanted no crew. I felt somewhat like Ahab beginning a doomed voyage. I thought I should spare any crew.

I took with me 4 full discographies. Yours, Pink Floyd, Radiohead, and the greatest Greek of the 20th century, Savvopoulos. And two books, Moby Dick by Melville, and Odyssey by Homer.

A week in the journey this happened. I was doing a long night sail. I always enjoy night sails. The wind was light and fair, no land or human in sight. No sound from an engine but the sails gently flapping in the wind, and the bow slowly advancing through the water. I was traversing a large stretch of water eastwards, from Mykonos to Patmos. The Milky Way was shining on top of me like a crown of all that has ever been. Ghosteen was on the speakers. I was having my coffee and my morning joint (you will hopefully not share this with the Hellenic coast guard!) all alone in the very first light.

As the sun begun to break from the horizon (as I was travelling eastward), Galleon Ship entered. I stood there, all alone, watching a thousand-galleon ships sailing, “ghostly around the morning sun.”

I broke down. I was overwhelmed. It brought me to my knees. I was kneeling in the cockpit, in the twilight, moving slowly towards the sun, crying my heart out. The closest to a prayer a non-believer can experience.

And then of course, the way you have the album arranged, Ghosteen started speaking to me.

I am beside you
I am beside you
Look for me

Suddenly everything made sense. I could physically sense and see the Ghosteen. Everyone singing to be free, broke free. I could almost physically sense all that has ever been, and all that will ever be. Everything had somehow clicked in my head. Loss was okay. It was only part of the game. The beauty of it all came in the foreground. I rose up and smiled at the emerging sun.

So I guess all I’m trying to say is this:

1) I want you to know I can see and sense the Ghosteen. It will be with me forever. Until I close my eyes.

2) Thank you.","Dear Stathis,

What’s your advice?

Next Question

It looks like your website is censoring people who ask about Israel. Wtf?

Next Question

Why are you playing in Israel?","Dear Poliana,

 Thank you for the many and varied letters you have sent to The Red Hand Files. They have not gone unnoticed, and it is always a pleasure to hear from you.

 Personally, I think it would be a mistake not to have a baby because of Israel’s occupation of Palestine. I suspect in the long term you may live to regret that decision.

 In my experience something can happen to a new parent, a perception shift, as they are absorbed into the strange and absolute universe of the child, where the problems of the outside world temporarily retreat. There can be, on a deep level, a radical softening of one’s adversarial or pessimistic position toward the world, as the baby reconfigures our understanding of it. Things look less grim.

 This has certainly been the case for me. I would say that my own children have gone a long way toward amplifying and energising my understanding of the world’s potential. They have become bright windows through which I can imagine the world anew. Despite our perilous predicament, they have turned me into a cautious optimist, as I watch them go about making things better. There are many reasons people don’t have children, of course, but to choose not to have them as a reaction to the state of the world seems, to me, defeatist and sad.

 As for your question on Israel, I will refer you to Issue #13 where I lay out my reasons for playing Israel — no need to do that again here, they’ve changed little. I can assure you, though, that there is no censorship of questions relating to Israel on my website, and this will be evidenced by the usual cascade of letters I will receive from the boycott advocates, after posting this Issue.

 However, let me just say this. My music is not designed to reward people for good behaviour, nor do I make music to punish people for bad behaviour. My music is not conditional. It is for everybody, regardless of their actions, good or bad or otherwise. I hope my music has the capacity to advance the world in a positive direction. I say my music because I believe each musician should be afforded the respect to arrive at their own understanding of what the exact purpose of their music is.

 Yes, I do have an interest in magic, or at least I used to. My boy, Arthur, became obsessed with it when he was about thirteen and for a year, maybe more, all he did was magic. Every day he sat around shuffling cards and flipping coins, and watching endless online magic tutorials and DVDs by his favourite magicians. He joined The Young Magicians Club at The Magic Circle and I would drive him around to magic shows and magician’s conventions and trade shows and magic shops. He practised and practised and became really good at it.

 In the summer of 2014, in Los Angeles, we spent much of our time down on Hollywood Blvd watching the street magicians, and Arthur would show them his magic tricks and they would show him theirs. We hung out at the Magic Castle every Saturday that summer, and entered this strange community of magicians, who taught Arthur the Classic Pass and the Double Turnover and the various coin tricks, and Arthur got so good at sleight of hand it seemed that there was nothing he couldn’t make disappear.

 Our dear friend Larry ‘Ratso ’Sloman, who wrote the definitive book on Harry Houdini, introduced us to the great David Blaine — we went to his house and Arthur showed him a couple of his tricks and David called Arthur ‘a good magician’, then took out a deck of cards and completely blew our minds. Later on he gave Arthur the novel, Siddhartha, by Hermann Hesse, which Arthur never read, but kept next to his bed.

 Then one day, back in Brighton, Arthur just stopped doing magic completely. I asked him why and he just shrugged and said, “I don’t want to do it any more, dad”, and that was the end of that — and, I suppose, the end of my active interest in magic, too.

 Richard, I hope I’ve answered your question. I am sorry that maybe in the end these words are not addressed to you. Maybe these words are projected beyond this world, as a wish, as a prayer, as a sleight of hand, hoping they may draw the attention of the spirits themselves. Our boy, our magician, our vanisher — we miss you.

 Freedom for me is the ability to relinquish control of the outcome of things and so, in this respect, I agree with Nina Simone; it is to be delivered from fear. These are fraught times but, for me, meditation, the loss of my son, and even the fact that I am just getting older, has allowed me to arrive at a place where I do not feel at the mercy of consequence in the way that I used to — it doesn’t matter to me so much these days what happens. I feel that if I stay true to myself and follow my intuitions, if I surrender control of life’s outcomes, things tend to work out okay. On an artistic level, I play what I want to play, and say what I want to say, and let the chips fall where they may. This is a kind of freedom. As I have said before in The Red Hand Files, the universe has had its best shot at me and I am still kicking around. The Red Hand Files have played a significant part in this feeling of resilience to the capricious and indifferent nature of the world, they have made me stronger. Each answer I write seems to be an act of surrender, but at the same time a kind of armouring up — vulnerability as a form of protection.

 Tim, your question, that came in today, was the 30,000th one. It is also two years this week since I started The Red Hand Files and I can’t tell you how much this means to me. On top of that, this week was my lovely wife’s birthday and also the funeral of my dear, dear mother. Thank you to the many people who offered their condolences at the loss of my mother and reminded me, over and over again, of her beautiful words —

 “Head high and fuck ‘em all!”

 She was the greatest.

And if so, will the anchor always be burdened by the weight of having been used?","Dear Tom,

 An anchor without a ship is just a useless lump of iron that lies at the bottom of the sea. An anchor serves no purpose once the ship has set sail.

 In my song ‘Waiting for You’ I wrote —

  

 Your body is my anchor

 I never asked to be freed

  

 — and even though the context is different I understand the painful place you are in and I in no way want to diminish it, however, your current state is ultimately unsustainable and, well, seeing as we are dealing in metaphors there is no reason we can’t at least entertain the possibility that you might be a ship that just thinks it is an anchor.

 The revealing part of your question is the last few words “burdened by the weight of having been used”. If you continue to see yourself in this self-defeating light, whether it is true or not, you will remain that twisted lump of metal at the bottom of the ocean.

 My wish for you, my friend — and all the other abandoned anchors that write to me from the ocean floor — is that a time will come when you can reimagine yourself, not as the poor old stalwart anchor rusting on the sea bottom, but as a fucking ship and get back on the surface of the water and do what ships do — venture forth and begin again the strange, dangerous, glorious, storm-tossed voyage of life!

113,September 2020,https://www.theredhandfiles.com/breathless-moves-me-beyond-words,breathless-moves-me-beyond-words,1,SCOTT,DUNEDIN,NEW ZEALAND,"On The Lyre of Orpheus, the track Breathless moves me beyond words. In the intro every time I hear it I’m taken to a 14th or 16th century style ensemble. Is that the intention or can you explain where that comes from?","Dear Scott,

 About thirty years ago, when Dirty Three were still playing the little clubs in Melbourne, Conway Savage, who was the newly appointed piano player in the Bad Seeds, was in the audience watching the band. He had not seen Dirty Three before, nor had he met Warren. In the song ‘Indian Love Song’ Warren played the flute.

 Now, you must understand that Conway was a guy from an obscure town in rural Victoria called Fish Creek with a population of about ninety people and, at the time, his musical taste didn’t extend too far beyond traditional country and western music.

 Conway introduced himself to Warren after the gig saying — “Good show, mate, but if I see you play that flute again I’ll ram it up your arse.”

 So, Warren quietly put his flute away in its case and there it lay, untouched, for over a decade.

 It’s 2004 and The Bad Seeds are in Ferber studios in Paris for the Abattoir Blues sessions. Warren is now in the band and we had just recorded the song ‘Breathless’, an upbeat number that begins —

 Conway had done some lovely rollicking piano on it and gone back to the hotel.I felt that the song needed a solo instrument on the opening bars, so that the song began in a happy, life-affirming way, so I say to Warren — “Have you got a flute?”

 Warren says — “Um, yes.”

 I say — “I think this song needs some flute. Let’s put some on tomorrow.”

 Warren says — “Well, we’d better do it in the morning before Conway comes in because he told me years ago that if I ever played the flute again he would ram it up my arse.”

 So, the next day I set up a space for Warren to play the flute — a meditation cushion and a circle of scented candles and some incense and stuff like that.

 Warren arrives with his flute and says — “Is Conway here?”

 And I say — “No.”

 So, Warren sits down on the cushion and we bring the lights down, put on ‘Breathless’, and Warren plays the flute on the introduction. Now, Warren hasn’t played the flute since Conway said he’d stick it up his arse, so Warren is more than a bit rusty and the flute sounds like shit. So we do it again.

 I say to him — “Relax and play like a seven year old child that has just been given his first recorder.”

 So Warren plays it again and it still sounds terrible. “Give me another go,” he says.

 So Warren does, like, another ten takes and they each sound progressively worse than the one before. Warren does the Walk of Shame back into the control booth.

 “The flute sounds like shit,” I say to Warren.

 “Right,” says Warren.

 “How about we listen to them all back at the same time,” I say.

 Warren says — “And let’s put some of them backwards.”

 And I say — “And let’s detune some of them and stick them through a phaser, and drench the whole thing in reverb.”

 So, Nick Launay, the producer, messes around with the flute, and then plays all the takes back at the same time — some backwards, some detuned, some phased — and it sounds like an incredibly fucked-up 14th or 16th Century style ensemble, as you say, Scott. Warren has a big smile on his face.

 “Beautiful,” he says.

 Then Conway comes in.

 Conway sits down, lights a cigarette, opens a beer, listens for a bit and says — “Is that a flute?”

 Warren says in a small voice — “No.”

 May 2017 and we are in Brooklyn for rehearsals for the American Skeleton Tree tour. Conway collapses in the lobby of the One Hotel and is rushed to hospital, where he undergoes emergency surgery to remove a tumour from his brain. Conway remains in hospital and we head off on tour without him.

 After the tour, there is a letter waiting for Warren back home in Paris. The letter reads —

 “Warren, I was wrong about the flute. Conway.”

 Though Conway’s operation was a success, it was a short reprieve — Conway would never tour with the Bad Seeds again and a year later, on this day in 2018, Conway passed away taking the ramshackle soul of the Bad Seeds with him.

 People often ask me if I miss past members of the Bad Seeds and the answer is, ‘Well, not really.’ But I miss Conway. We all miss Conway. We miss him a lot. Things are not the same without him.

 Just as an aside. Back in 2004, we released Breathless as a single, but the BBC radio refused to play it. They loved the song but they didn’t like the flute. Our record company at the time recalled the song and removed the flute. The BBC played it. It was a flop.

The cover versions were awesome. Many of them, as far as I am concerned, were glorious advancements on the originals. Maria Højrup’s gorgeous Bright Horses, the operatic Avalanche, Saint Agnes’ chilling and superior No Pussy Blues and Asa’s Loverman-riot, the absolutely epic Galleon Ship and the super-disturbing Jack the Ripper, that seriously great Higgs Boson Blues from Ladyship Warship — wow, the rendition of Wild Rose (finally in tune), and the beautiful Covid-harp version, the Watching Alice snuff video, Paul at the piano playing Push the Sky Away, the kid singing We No Who U R on the acoustic guitar in the Clash t-shirt, and many other lovely versions of this song, the truly celestial Girl in Amber — so beautiful, the cool aborted country version of Loverman, the couple singing Henry Lee in Italian, the woman singing a weird and wonderful Far From Me, the Kubrick/Clément West Country Girl, the consistently exquisite genius of Gelareh Pour — we are simply not worthy, my dear, and poor Woody still in the bath, the cutest duet of People Ain’t No Good ever, the guy in his kitchen in his socks playing a radically lovely interpretation of O Children and Nick and Yana’s super-eerie version of the same song, the deeply enchanting I Let Love In and the full-on version, the brilliantly evil Up Jumped the Devil, the Dead Writers’ astonishing Are You the One That I’ve Been Waiting For? and the instrumental version, the lovely Stranger Than Kindness dance-with-the–devil-mini-movie, the girl playing the joyful, kamikaze version of Good, Good Day — a personal favourite, the girl singing Henry Lee with the flowers in her hair, the handsome guys playing More News from Nowhere in their shed, the Serbian ukulele Mercy Seat, the sultry Shivers, the unbelievably brave version of From Her to Eternity from the girl sitting on the floor, Jake Shane who takes Fireflies and totally claims it as his own, Tom Rabu’s superlative, amputated We No Who U R and Jubilee Street instrumental — my God!, and the epic guitar version of the same song, the hard rock Fifteen Feet of Pure White Snow, complete with Moog synthesizer solo, the loneliest and most sublime No More Shall We Part ever, the country Love Letter, the many gorgeous Into My Arms, the cool kid playing O Children on the unplugged electric guitar, the hysterical Lay Me Low, the devotional Bless His Ever Loving Heart, Straight to You in a gold cape, the girl singing an unearthly reworking of Skeleton Tree and Till Otte’s chilling version of the same song, the dreamy Push the Sky Away, the awesome Swedish Mercy Seat, the seriously pissed-off, wigged-out Christina the Astonishing, the satanic Song of Joy, a whole bunch of different people finally doing something cool with Red Right Hand, including PJ Brown and the D minor matchbox girl, and Ptolemy, of course, the goose-bumpy version of Hold Onto Yourself — a song I haven’t heard for years, the joyous Brompton Oratory trio, the mighty Sadegh’s Palaces of Montezuma and the funky version and the version in the club, the two girls’ well-needed reworking of The Weeping Song and The Weeping Song in a room of lights, the wonderful Cleopatra Weeping Song, the baptismal Weeping Song, and all the other Weeping Songs, the spooked-out Man in the Moon, the crystalline, heart-stopping Sun Forest, the intense Dig, Lazarus, Dig!!!, the punk-rock Idiot Prayer in a hazmat suit, Scott Casuccio’s ethereal voice, the acapella Push the Sky Away, the guy fucking going for it with O My Lord, the live Ship Song, the Loom of the Land duet, the nervy ‘solo’ Stagger Lee, Tino pouring his heart out, the groovy Lime Tree Arbour, the gorgeous candle-lit No More Shall We Part, the eerie version at the piano, and the super-groovy and drugged-out Messiah Ward, Herbert’s Wonderful Life, Joel’s awesome, other-worldly speak-song version of I had a Dream, Joe, the father singing Waiting For You with his son — Jesus, I wasn’t prepared for that — and then the girl playing it on the upright — wow, the fucked-up Nick the Stripper with the horse’s head, the wild version of Brother My Cup is Empty from Buenos Aires, the lovely God is in the House from Luiz Rocha, and on and on it went.

 But there were two songs, both off Ghosteen that, for me, stopped time itself. The deeply moving version of Spinning Song by Ilya Gruzdev, with its extraordinarily affecting home video footage, was such a strange, bold and emotional elevation of the original. I loved this. Watching it, well, it was very hard for me to keep my shit together.

 And the other song, Waiting For You by Juldiz, with its incredibly haunting video, felt like it was attached by the tips of its fingers to the very edge of the world and could float away at any moment. It really was one of the most beautiful and precarious musical moments I have heard in a very long time. It was a performance that emerged deep within the song itself, on that delicious brink of collapse where so much great art lives, beamed from a million sorrowing miles away. Unbelievably beautiful.

 Like I said, I was very affected by what I saw this weekend. We all were, I think, based on the love and support from the Bad Seed community in the comments section of the Vortex. There have been a lot of cover versions of my songs over the years, but rarely have I heard them played with such honesty, understanding, creativity, conviction and pure heart.

109,August 2020,https://www.theredhandfiles.com/what-is-mercy-for-you,what-is-mercy-for-you,2,VALERIO; FRANCES,TURIN; LOS ANGELES,ITALY; USA,"What is mercy for you?

Next Question

What do you think of cancel culture?","Dear Valerio and Frances,

 Mercy is a value that should be at the heart of any functioning and tolerant society. Mercy ultimately acknowledges that we are all imperfect and in doing so allows us the oxygen to breathe — to feel protected within a society, through our mutual fallibility. Without mercy a society loses its soul, and devours itself.

 Mercy allows us the ability to engage openly in free-ranging conversation — an expansion of collective discovery toward a common good. If mercy is our guide we have a safety net of mutual consideration, and we can, to quote Oscar Wilde, “play gracefully with ideas.”

 Yet mercy is not a given. It is a value we must nurture and aspire to. Tolerance allows the spirit of enquiry the confidence to roam freely, to make mistakes, to self-correct, to be bold, to dare to doubt and in the process to chance upon new and more advanced ideas. Without mercy society grows inflexible, fearful, vindictive and humourless.

 Frances, you’ve asked about cancel culture. As far as I can see, cancel culture is mercy’s antithesis. Political correctness has grown to become the unhappiest religion in the world. Its once honourable attempt to reimagine our society in a more equitable way now embodies all the worst aspects that religion has to offer (and none of the beauty) — moral certainty and self-righteousness shorn even of the capacity for redemption. It has become quite literally, bad religion run amuck.

 Cancel culture’s refusal to engage with uncomfortable ideas has an asphyxiating effect on the creative soul of a society. Compassion is the primary experience — the heart event — out of which emerges the genius and generosity of the imagination. Creativity is an act of love that can knock up against our most foundational beliefs, and in doing so brings forth fresh ways of seeing the world. This is both the function and glory of art and ideas. A force that finds its meaning in the cancellation of these difficult ideas hampers the creative spirit of a society and strikes at the complex and diverse nature of its culture.

 But this is where we are. We are a culture in transition, and it may be that we are heading toward a more equal society — I don’t know — but what essential values will we forfeit in the process?

108,August 2020,https://www.theredhandfiles.com/the-lyrics-just-arent-coming,the-lyrics-just-arent-coming,1,MARKO,ZAGREB,CROATIA,What do you do when the lyrics just aren’t coming?,"Dear Marko,

 In my experience, lyrics are almost always seemingly just not coming. This is the tearful ground zero of song writing — at least for some of us. This lack of motion, this sense of suspended powerlessness, can feel extraordinarily desperate for a songwriter. But the thing you must hold on to through these difficult periods, as hard as it may be, is this — when something’s not coming, it’s coming. It took me many years to learn this, and to this day I have trouble remembering it.

 The idea of lyrics ‘not coming’ is basically a category error. What we are talking about is not a period of ‘not coming’ but a period of ‘not arriving’. The lyrics are always coming. They are always pending. They are always on their way toward us. But often they must journey a great distance and over vast stretches of time to get there. They advance through the rugged terrains of lived experience, battling to arrive at the end of our pen. In time, they emerge, leaping free of the unknown — from memory or, more thrillingly, from the predictive part of our minds that exists on the far side of the lived moment. It has been a long and arduous journey, and our waiting much anguished.

 Marko, our task is both simple and extremely difficult. Our task is to remain patient and vigilant and to not lose heart — for we are the destination. We are the portals from which the idea explodes, forced forth by its yearning to arrive. We are the revelators, the living instruments through which the idea announces itself — the flourishing and the blooming — but we are also the waiting and the wondering and the worrying. We are all of these things — we are the songwriters.

Was it a personal instrument, or is this just the kind of thing people put in front of one when they go places?","Dear Andrew,

 The piano I played at Alexandra Palace was a Fazioli. There were limited pianos I could access during lockdown. There was, however, a Fazioli. I had never played one before but Dom Monks, the guy who recorded the Alexandra Palace performance, highly recommended this piano. The moment I sat down at the Fazioli, its warm, soft, nuanced sound spoke to me like no piano had spoken to me before. I was swept away by its extraordinary tonal range. It whispered to me. It roared at me. It was the most beautiful instrument I had ever played.

 On a Zoom call to my manager I mentioned how much I loved the Fazioli. I reminded him that I still have the same nasty little Chinese upright I have had for over thirty years. I explained that I was sixty-three years old and suggested that perhaps it was time I got a nice piano. I said to my manager — I just love that Fazioli.

 Now, one of the things you may or may not know about being a famous musician is that companies give you shit for free. The more famous you are, the more shit you get — you just have to wear one of their t-shirts or a branded cap or something. Being the principled individual that I am, of course, I have never sponsored a musical instrument (in that respect, I am virtually alone in my field) but I just loved that Fazioli.

 So I said to my manager — Time to sell my soul. Time to make a call and get me a Fazioli.

 My manager said — Consider it done!

 So, the next day my manager rings up Fazioli, who have their headquarters in Sacile, in the Province of Pordenone, near Venice and an Italian woman answers the phone.

 My manager says — I represent the great artist Nick Cave and I am wondering if I could get a free Fazioli (or something like that).

 The Italian woman says — L’acttore?

 My manager says — What?

 She says — The actor?

 My manager says — No, Cave. Cave.

 And she says — Nick what?

 My manager says — Nick Cave.

 She says — Nick Cave? Who issa Nick Cave?

 My manager says — Well, he is arguably the greatest songwriter of his time. He is one of the cornerstones of modern music. He is a national treasure. He is adored by millions. Italians love him.

 She says — Who are you? What you want?

 My manager says — Um, a free piano.

 And she hangs up.

 * * * *

 A couple of days later I’m on another Zoom call with my manager, and he is looking a bit cagey and I say — How did it go with Fazioli? Did you get me a free Fazioli?

 And my manager says — Well, it seems like they have a rather inflexible policy around giving away £200,000 pianos to people they’ve never heard of.

 And I say — Dude, are you my fucking manager or what? I just love that Fazioli!

 So the next day my manager rings back Fazioli and the same woman answers the phone and my manager says — Look it’s Nick Cave’s manager again, can I speak to Mr Fazioli.

 And the woman says — No.

 And my manager says — Listen, my fucking job’s on the line here.

 And she hangs up.

 * * * *

 So, Andrew, I agree — the Fazioli is a glorious piano. Magnificent, as you say. As Herbie Hancock said about his Fazioli — that ‘one note announces the celebration of the freedom and creativity of the human spirit’. This is true. The Fazioli is warm and delicate and remarkably subtle, but has a deep, strong heart. It is full of angel tears and il sangue dei santi and encompasses the universe. It is a dream piano.And yet I wait for the day a giant removal van will pull up outside my house, my manager hanging out the passenger window, wearing a t-shirt with a piano on it, and a big smile on his face, screaming ‘Fazioli!’

 Until then my little Chinese upright grins at me from the corner of my room. I walk over and sit down and I begin to play.

It’s unknown and unspoken territory to me. I thought it was fine. I thought it was fine. It was a gentle passing. Now shapes and echoes resound. I feel a presence that comes and goes – a comforting presence, gentle and protective.
I don’t understand it. I don’t believe in a god that sits above. I feel a presence in all things – something mysterious and miraculous. Sometimes I gaze gently at birds and trees and am deeply moved by the life that hums in them. For I love birds and trees especially the sparrows and tall trees with wide branches.
It’s strange to feel so connected and yet have a feeling of being so disconnected. At times I’m fine – more than fine as they are here and I forget I lost them and my memories hold the space of all things we shared. My question is I don’t know how to understand the experience of loss. It’s not something I could negotiate with. I hope this makes some sense.","Dear Rose,

 I have printed your letter in full as it describes very beautifully the experience of inhabiting the uncanny and disorientating realm of loss. Thank you for taking such care with it.

 The paradoxical effect of losing a loved one is that their sudden absence can become a feverish comment on that which remains. That which remains rises in time from the dark with a burning physicality — a luminous super-presence — as we acquaint ourselves with this new and different world. In loss things – both animate and inanimate – take on an added intensity and meaning.

 I love your line —
‘Sometimes I gaze gently at birds and trees and am deeply moved by the life that hums in them.’

 I think this feeling you describe, of alertness to the inner-spirit of things — this humming — comes from a hard-earned understanding of the impermanence of things and, indeed, our own impermanence. This lesson ultimately animates and illuminates our lives. We become witnesses to the thrilling emergency of the present — a series of exquisite and burning moments, each extinguished as the next arises. These magical moments are the bright jewels of loss to which we cling. They are your ‘sparrows and tall trees with wide branches.’

 For there is, of course, another side where we lose our resolve — we drop our guard, or just grow tired and descend into that other, darker, less-lovely world, as we disconnect and retreat deep into ourselves.

 Rose, these revolving feelings of connection and disconnection you describe so well are the opposing forces of loss that define our lived experience. Letters like yours make a great difference because many of us inhabit this uncanny realm of loss — and all of us will find our way there in time.

 Much of my creative energy comes from a focused exchange of ideas with other people — I would call that the collaborative spirit. The collaborative spirit is essentially a strategy for responding to the world. In this respect The Red Hand Files are a collaboration, and it is the received energy from the ever-growing number of questions that brings me back each week to this place of acknowledgement and gratitude. It feels like a shared project.

 So it is with Susie. I have been married to her for over twenty years, and our marriage itself is an ever-evolving alliance or collaboration. The work that we do — Susie with The Vampire’s Wife, and me with my own work — is a form of self-actualising that emerges from the energy of our relationship.

 It is not that I discuss my lyrics with her, rather my lyrics radiate from a life lived together. My words are not just a way of making sense of our relationship, they also participate in it, magnify it, and enhance it. It is the same with Susie’s dresses. They are ghost-like articulations of the mysterious and preternatural part of her nature, as seen through our relationship. The designing and creating of these dresses, like the writing of my words, emerge out of our shared experience; and these creative endeavours, these songs and dresses, in turn, imagine our relationship alive — and around and around it goes, each dreaming up the other.

 These days, there is little I do that is not done in the spirit of collaboration. We are drawn together at the behest of the world to attend to its needs. This world itself is our communal experiment — all of ours — a shared project of extraordinary complexity in which we are all participating, and through which each of our actions resound through time. We each impact upon the other, and are each in service of the other. This is the true energy of the collaborative spirit.

 In 1972 Nina Simone released a live album entitled Emergency Ward! that was, by her own admission, her oppositional response to the Vietnam War. This record begins with an eighteen-minute rendition of ‘My Sweet Lord’, that could well be her greatest musical achievement. Nina Simone’s interpretation of George Harrison’s gentle cosmic entreaty ends up, in her hands, as a howl of spiritual abandonment and accusation.

 The song begins with a thirty-second chant of —

 We want Nina!

 We want Nina!

 before the band launches into a raucous reanimation of the George Harrison classic. Nina’s entry couldn’t be more casual, inside the manic energy of the song —

 Oh my Lord

 My sweet Lord

 This rendition is a gospel thrill ride, with mantras, wild syncopated handclaps and weird background whoops, courtesy of the Bethany Baptist Church Junior Choir of South Jamaica, New York. The Hare Krishna chant has been removed and more ‘Hallelujahs’ have been added as Nina reaches back to her Methodist roots and proclaims —

 I really want to see you, Lord

 But it takes so long

 And further on —

 The world is looking for you

 Won’t you show yourself, Lord?

 then surges back in, each time with increased abandon. At around six minutes there is an exquisite breakdown and Nina’s plea grows more pressing —

 I really want to see you

 I really need to see you

 But everything today is a killer

 Today is a killer

 Today is a killer

 How am I gonna see you?

 Nobody has taught us any patience, Lord

 And now it is too late, too late, my Lord

 And yet again the song storms back in, the sense of cosmic desertion growing stronger and stronger. Each breakdown, each entreaty, each surge becomes more fraught, as if the whole world is fracturing and collapsing around Nina’s petitions.

 At twelve minutes Nina incorporates a poem by David Nelson of The Last Poets and the song falls into a kind of weird reverie —

 I often sit there in the sea

 And dream dreams

 And hope hopes

 And wish wishes

 And I listen to the wind song

 As it dances a beautiful dance for me

 But these moments never last long…

 And there is a further rupturing of the narrative as Nina drags us into the sudden horror of the historical moment, with lines like —

 Comes the reality of today

 Grinning its all-knowing, fiendish grin

 Pressing his ugly face against mine

 Staring at me with lifeless eyes

 Crumbling away all memories of yesterday’s dreams

 Because today is a killer

 And only you can save us, Lord

 Nina still beseeching, still calling into the vacuum —

 I certainly never hoped

 That one day I’d be screaming

 Something my mother told me I needed

 In the beginning

 In the beginning

 In the beginning

 and then a long held note, an ululation cast into the roaring void, as her meditation turns finally, to condemn the indifferent heavens and her ‘sweet Lord’ for his ultimate betrayal —

 Today, where are you, Lord?

 YOU ARE A KILLER!

 The great Nina Simone was a living grievance machine — her race, her gender, her misused talents (she wanted to be a classical pianist) — and this rage infused all her work, and is what makes it so multi-layered. Even her most beautiful love songs, which I count as some of the most incandescent works of art ever recorded, were marinated in a sense of resentment and contempt for the workings of the world. It is this exhilarating collision of opposing forces — love and scorn — that makes Nina Simone’s existential and political protestations so compelling.

 In this extraordinarily bold statement, Nina Simone stands defiant in the face of spiritual oblivion, and a world (and God) that so readily allows war and senseless carnage to occur. It is a protest song par excellence that serves as a form of transport, a vehicle that takes us on a complex and nuanced journey into transcendent rage. The song itself becomes a forge of fury, where Nina Simone stands conflicted and defiant and, in the final lines, pulls the heavens crashing down around our ears.

 Perhaps, this is the voice of protest we need right now — intelligent, questing, transcendent, raging and thrillingly complex —

 We want Nina!

 We want Nina!

 Indeed.

(This is not a challenge, there is no aggression in this question; I simply want you to think about it and elucidate).

Next Question

What is love for you?","Dear Tom and Pablo,

 The voice in ‘Ghosteen Speaks’ is not my own. It is the emergent expression of an invisible, migratory spirit — the Ghosteen. It is the spirit of love and mercy. Throughout the song, the Ghosteen announces its presence — I am beside you. Look for me.

 It says — I am invisible, but I am here. Search for me, and you will find me.

 It calls to the compassionate act of witnessing — of seeing.

 Love has something to do with the notion of being seen — the opposite of invisibility. The invisible, the unwitnessed, the unacknowledged, the isolated, the lonely — these are the unloved. Loving attention illuminates the unseen, escorting them from the frontiers of lovelessness into the observed world. To truly see someone — anyone — is an act that acknowledges and forgives our common and imperfect humanity. Love enacts a kind of vigilant perception — whether it is to a partner, a child, a co-worker, a neighbour, a fellow citizen, or any other person one may encounter in this life. Love says softly — I see you. I recognise you. You are human, as am I.

 To pay witness to another, in an alert and loving manner, is essentially an act of forgiveness for it is to acknowledge with compassion our mutual human capacity for all things, both good and evil.

 When we reduce each other to symbols or representations, rather than see each other as the complex, flawed human beings that we are, we engage in the very antithesis of mercy — heartlessness, condemnation and sanctimoniousness. Within this baleful clamour the luminous spirits of compassion retreat.

 I am beside you. Look for me — call the windswept voices of love, to all that have the forbearance to hear.

Do you ever look back at your anthology and wish you had been more overtly politically outspoken – referring to activism rather than politics per se – in your art?","Dear JP,

 Perhaps the thing you enjoy about my songs is that they are conflicted, and often deal in uncertainties and ambiguities. My better songs seem to be engaged in an interior struggle between opposing outlooks or states of mind. They rarely settle on anything. My songs sit in that liminal space between decided points of view.

 Songs with political agendas inhabit a different space. They have little patience for nuance, neutrality or impartiality. Their aim is to get the message across in as clear and persuasive a manner as possible. There can be great value in these sorts of songs, but they are usually born from a particular combination of rigidity and zealousness, which I personally do not possess. My songs seem to be resistant to fixed, inflexible points of view. They have, as you say, a concern for common, non-hierarchical suffering. They are not in the business of saving the world; rather they are in the business of saving the soul of the world.

 Sometimes my songs speak into the current situation and sometimes they do not. I am mostly happy with that. I am happy that people can come to my songs and — even though they may be challenging or confronting — they do not preach and do not divide, and are offered to everyone, without exception.

 I have very little control over what songs I write. They are constructed, incrementally, in the smallest of ways, the greater meaning revealing itself after the fact. They are often slippery, amorphous things, with unclear trajectories — position-free attempts at understanding the mysteries of the heart. I guess I could write a protest song, but I think I would, in the end, feel compromised in doing so, not because there aren’t things I am fundamentally opposed to — there are — but because I would be using my particular talents to deal with something I consider to be morally obvious. Personally, I have little inclination to do that. It’s just not what I do.

 Normally, to answer this question I would simply go to my bookshelves and choose forty books. However, my bookshelves are completely empty. The 5000+ books I have accumulated over the years have been shipped to the Royal Danish Library in Copenhagen. They are now part of the completely mind-blowing, heart-stopping Stranger Than Kindness exhibition. Without my library in front of me it is a little difficult to assemble a comprehensive list of my forty most loved books. The best I can do is throw together a rather formless and incoherent grab bag of titles that come to mind at this moment that, for one reason or another, I have loved over the years. I think I got carried away. I think there are fifty — in no particular order.

99,May 2020,https://www.theredhandfiles.com/identity-coherent-fit-together,identity-coherent-fit-together,2,ELEONORA; MAX,BRUSSELS; HAMBURG,BELGIUM; GERMANY,"I feel that our identity is a patchwork of desires, choices, affiliation, eccentricity. [ ] I found that, sometimes, those identities that inhabit me are in conflict and it is hard to cope with this lack of coherence. Do you have any thoughts on how to make our inner selves “coherent” or how to let all the bits fit together? Do you think that is necessary?

Next Question

What do you personally look for in an artist?","Dear Eleonora and Max,

 I think that for some of us it is almost impossible to have a cohesive identity or, rather, there are some whose inconsistent and conflicted sense of self is their identity. There are those who have an identity that is contrary and evolving and forever at war with itself. It is perpetually in the process of challenging its own best ideas. Once an idea of self — a stance, a point of view, an identity — is settled upon, this inner subversive begins the business of dismantling it. Yet, this resistance to a fixed identity could be our greatest strength.

 Perhaps I inherited this tendency from my father, who had, to say the least, a perverse and contrary view of the world, or maybe it is because I was born between star signs, or it could just be the old boomer in me that continues to have a nostalgic fondness for disruption and chaos, but I have forever felt a horror of being boxed in by an identity and an inflexible opinion, for this allegiance to a single personae can be the very death of creativity.

 Maybe, Eleonora, there is some advantage in not having those ‘bits fit together’. This lack of cohesion prevents us from being enslaved by absolutes — what is true and what is not true, what is the right way to be and what is the wrong way to be — and affords us the ability to embrace contradictory ideas at the same time.

 For an artist, particularly a songwriter, this ability to be open to influence, to discard personae, gives us the freedom to express ourselves in contrasting ways. When I think about the artists who have had the greatest impact on me, this fluctuating and disordered identity, and necessity to reinvent themselves, is common to most of them. I think this is what I look for in an artist — the ability to change, and to grow, and to confound.

Are you that honest with yourself?

Next Question

How many Red Hand File questions do you get a week and how do you choose which to respond to?","Dear Mark and Paul,

 The poet David Whyte wrote, “The fear of loss is the motivator behind all conscious and unconscious dishonesties.” I found there to be so much truth in these words. After my son died and I eventually stepped from the darkness back into the world, I brought with me a gift that I feel I am only beginning to understand. “The gauntlet with a gift in it,” as Elizabeth Barrett Browning so beautifully wrote. I felt that my family and I had been tested and that we had survived, and this gift that I carried was the freedom to be honest with myself and with others — as there was nothing left to conceal. The protective shell that I had constructed around myself, my old life, had been torn away. I had been exposed, and I had nothing left to defend. The gift in the gauntlet was a new and raw honesty toward myself and toward the world.

 Because, you see, the world had done its worst. What harm was left to be done? What remained to fear? What was left to lose that I could not survive? I felt extraordinarily liberated by this, protected by the calamity itself and perversely invincible within my own vulnerability. Deception, artifice and keeping up appearances took up too much energy — I didn’t have the stamina for my own pretence and little patience for it in others.

 Honesty is simply a declaration of one’s own vulnerability — it is its keen, bright edge — and my own vulnerability and the vulnerability of others became, in the end, a kind of shared armour. I learned that, ultimately, our own truth and sense of self is all any of us have. We are enough, if we could only allow ourselves to be.

 This is the great value of The Red Hand Files. The questions that come in, so often naked and damaged and honest, offer me a form of salvation. I am the only one who accesses these questions, as I enter a sequestered world of mutual need. I read the questions each day, maybe fifty or so, sometimes more. It is like reading weird, brutal subterranean poetry, and like poetry they need to be read closely and with care. This exercise has become an essential part of my daily work.

 The ones I feel I can answer I put into a file. Then when the time comes to write something I choose a question that feels in need of a response. The particular question always leaps out at me, as if waiting its turn to be answered. I feel at home among these questions, exalted and protected by them. It is an absolute honour to be a part of this undertaking, whatever it is and wherever it may lead.

 I wrote the line –

 I slide my little songs out from under you

 on the evening of the 5th of July 2014.

 I know this because I refer to it in the Portland section of The Sick Bag Song, the epic poem I composed chronicling The Bad Seeds 2014 North American tour. I wrote –

 ‘Tonight I wrote down this line in the alley
Behind the Arlene Schnitzer Concert Hall
In Portland, Oregon
Where I smoked and sat,
I slide my little songs out from under you
And I was very happy with that.’

 What I meant by ‘very happy with that’ was that I felt a blissful pulse of prophecy calling from the future, that this line, written in an alley, in Portland, had an ulterior destiny that would in time reveal itself.

 It appeared again in the Los Angeles section of The Sick Bag Song –

 ‘I cast a giant shadow against the sky.
Like a miniature deity I gaze into the brown water.
I slide my little songs out from under you.
I am a small god crawling around a giant world,
Becoming an engorged god crawling around a small world.’

 But happy as I was with the line, and indeed the whole of The Sick Bag Song, I felt that I needed to position it within an actual song, so I spent the next six years trying to do just that. This became increasingly difficult, as every song I tried to put it in rejected it. It was just too good, I guess, and the other lines knew it. I remember one mercifully aborted song lyric went something like –

 ‘Praise be your za-zen legs and kundalini stew
I slide my little songs out from under you’

 Looking through my notebook I see it even tried its luck in an early version of ‘Rings of Saturn’ –

 ‘As she jumps up with her leaping brain
I slide my little songs out from under her
Stepping over piles of sleeping children’

 But ‘Rings of Saturn’ would have none of it and the line was (thankfully) shunned and, once again, sent into exile.

 Then it turned up on a potential B-side from the Skeleton Tree sessions called ‘Life Per Se’, which you saw me trying to teach the band on the 40 minute jam in One More Time With Feeling –

 ‘What then to do? What then to do?
I slide my little songs out from under you’

 But this song, beautiful though it was, didn’t end up on an actual record, so the line still had no place to lay its head.

 The line seemed, as you pointed out, Natasha, to sum up everything – a life’s work, a credo, an ideology. I felt the line struck at the heart of the matter – that my songs were small studies in a larger project – the glorification of the ones I love.

 In the end it found its way into ‘Night Raid’ from Ghosteen –

 ‘Sitting on the edge of the bed clicking your shoes
I slid my little songs out from under you’

 A near perfect place for it really, as ‘Night Raid’ is concerned mostly with the act of impregnation, of conception, of genesis, and the line –

 ‘I slid my little songs out from under you’

 felt like the feminine counterweight to the overwrought masculinity of –

 ‘The spurting font of creativity, yeah I know’

 This lovely line allowed the yang seed to fertilise the yin egg, up in Room 33, and birth what, in my opinion, may be the most beautiful and joyful song on the album.

 But even so, I am still not completely sure the line has found its final resting place. It feels that it was created for a grander purpose, to be chiselled in granite, in a Luminari font, maybe; so, if it comes down to it, Frank, this is what I want on my gravestone –

 I SLIDE MY LITTLE SONGS OUT FROM UNDER YOU

 unless, of course, I think of a better line in the meantime.

 Which brings me to Bad Seed TeeVee – thanks to all of you who have written in about it. Bad Seed TeeVee is in its infant stages, and now the project is up and running, mountains of new footage is flooding in from everywhere. We are besieged! In time, perhaps we will invite fans to send in interesting stuff they have shot on their phones while they were supposed to have been watching the concert. We want Bad Seed TeeVee to become a vast, ever-mutating monster – full of the bold, the beautiful, the berserk and the completely absurd.

How have you and your family been able to create meaning through such devastation?

Next Question

I am 16 weeks and three days in at losing my child, and although I have found solace in your last three albums, I am a truth seeker in the depths of grief. Aside from moving furniture, how did Susie and yourself find peace with your agonising grief?","Dear Carol and Luna,

 Susie and I have learned much about the nature of grief over recent years. We have come to see that grief is not something you pass through, as there is no other side. For us, grief became a way of life, an approach to living, where we learned to yield to the uncertainty of the world, whilst maintaining a stance of defiance to its indifference. We surrendered to something over which we had no control, but which we refused to take lying down. Grief became both an act of submission and of resistance — a place of acute vulnerability where, over time, we developed a heightened sense of the brittleness of existence. Eventually, this awareness of life’s fragility led us back to the world, transformed.

 We discovered that grief was much more than just despair. We found grief contained many things — happiness, empathy, commonality, sorrow, fury, joy, forgiveness, combativeness, gratitude, awe, and even a certain peace. For us, grief became an attitude, a belief system, a doctrine — a conscious inhabiting of our vulnerable selves, protected and enriched by the absence of the one we loved and that we lost.

 In the end, grief is an entirety. It is doing the dishes, watching Netflix, reading a book, Zooming friends, sitting alone or, indeed, shifting furniture around. Grief is all things reimagined through the ever emerging wounds of the world. It revealed to us that we had no control over events, and as we confronted our powerlessness, we came to see this powerlessness as a kind of spiritual freedom.

 Susie’s grief has become part of her chemistry, it moves through her bloodstream like a force, and though she often inhabits the liminal space at the edge of dreams, she remains strong in her powerlessness and obstinately awed by the workings of the world.

 Susie says to tell you she is very sorry to hear of your losses, very sorry, and looking at her now, I can only say to you both, that in time, there is a way, not out of grief, but deep within it.

94,April 2020,https://www.theredhandfiles.com/originality-hard-to-obtain,originality-hard-to-obtain,1,ELSE,PORTLAND,USA,"I recently read that the band Rising Signs believed ‘Palaces of Montezuma’ plagiarized their 2005 song, ‘Grey Man.’ Sure, I can hear similarities in melody, but, oddly, I think one of many reasons I love ‘Palaces’ is that it reminds me, if anything, of the intro to ‘Theme From Mad Flies, Mad Flies’ by The Laughing Clowns from 1982. I’m not sure what that says about Rising Signs, but it made me wonder – [ ] Is originality in music sometimes hard to obtain?","Dear Else,

 A lovely question, and one that brings us back to ‘Palaces of Montezuma.’ If I recall correctly, Warren wrote the chords and backing vocal line to this song. I just listened to Rising Signs‘ ‘Grey Man’ and it does sound pretty fucking similar. So, I phoned Warren, who is in lockdown in his studio in Paris, and asked him outright —

 “Did you steal ‘Palaces of Montezuma’ from Rising Signs?”

 “Fuck, no!” he says, “I stole it from The Laughing Clowns.”

 The great beauty of contemporary music, and what gives it its edge and vitality, is its devil-may-care attitude toward appropriation — everybody is grabbing stuff from everybody else, all the time. It’s a feeding frenzy of borrowed ideas that goes toward the advancement of rock music — the great artistic experiment of our era. 

 Plagiarism is an ugly word for what, in rock and roll, is a natural and necessary — even admirable — tendency, and that is to steal. Theft is the engine of progress, and should be encouraged, even celebrated, provided the stolen idea has been advanced in some way. To advance an idea is to steal something from someone and make it so cool and covetable that someone then steals it from you. In this way, modern music progresses, collecting ideas, and mutating and transforming as it goes.

 But a word of caution, if you steal an idea and demean or diminish it, you are committing a dire crime for which you will pay a terrible price — whatever talents you may have will, in time, abandon you. If you steal, you must honour the action, further the idea, or be damned. 

 So, ‘Deanna’ is based on ‘Oh Happy Day’, and the solo in the middle of ‘Red Right Hand’ may well have been stolen from ‘Bedazzled’, and ‘Tupelo’ leans heavily on John Lee Hooker’s song by the same name, and the theme from ‘The Road’ sounds like the arpeggio work of Arvo Pärt, and the guitar riff in ‘Nobody’s Baby Now’ probably came straight out of a Van Morrison tune and, well, ‘Palaces of Montezuma’, it turns out, is based on a song by The Laughing Clowns, and so it goes — ideas, beautiful ideas, in full flow. Even though the influences may seem obvious, each of these songs, I think, has its own ingenuity, its own value and its own meaning. We musicians all stand on the shoulders of each other, our pirate pockets rattling with booty, our heads exploding with repurposed ideas.

 “What else have you stolen?” I ask Warren.

 “Everything,” he says, “Absolutely, everything.”

 I love ‘Palaces of Montezuma’. I really do. Amid all the obvious excesses of Grinderman, this song stands out as a simple and heartfelt declaration of human love, with a surreal and wonderfully fucked up lyric. It has a sort of versatile inner spirit that seems to work in any form. I played it a number of times, solo at the piano, on my In Conversations tour — I was able to slow it down a bit and lean into the lyric and that seemed to work great too. I got to know the song pretty well.

 But even so, I’m not really sure what inspired the lyric. It’s not the sort of question I feel I have the authority to answer. These songs, you know, just present themselves. It seems to me to be essentially a cascade of increasingly bizarre and impossible acts of largesse, performed in the name of love. It seems to say, “I love you and I will give you the world — all I require is the smallest word.” What that word actually is remains a mystery — it may be love or sex or God or yes or thou or all — or not a word at all — a sigh — a grace. Whatever the word may be, it is essentially the whole world “contained in a grain of sand — that can barely walk, can’t even stand”. I suspect this idea may have migrated across time, and eventually found its way into the song ‘Ghosteen’, “There is nothing wrong with loving things that cannot even stand.” I don’t know. Just a thought. These ideas are wayfaring enigmas, for sure.

 I just put ‘Palaces of Montezuma’ on the record player and had a listen and, hearing it again after so long, something occurred to me. I can’t help but think that the song was helped along its way by the sweetly loony Lou Reed song, ‘Andy’s Chest’, from his album, Transformer. Perhaps that was the initial point of inspiration. I’m not sure. I hope so. I love Lou Reed. I really do.

92,April 2020,https://www.theredhandfiles.com/a-prayer-to-who,a-prayer-to-who,1,PATRICK,MELBOURNE,AUSTRALIA,A Prayer to who?,"Dear Patrick,

 The act of prayer is by no means exclusive to religious practise because prayer is not dependent on the existence of a subject. You need not pray to anyone. It is just as valuable to pray into your disbelief, as it is to pray into your belief, for prayer is not an encounter with an external agent, rather it is an encounter with oneself. There is as much chance of our prayers being answered by a God that exists as a God that doesn’t. I do not mean this facetiously, for prayers are very often answered.

 A prayer provides us with a moment in time where we can contemplate the things that are important to us, and this watchful application of our attention can manifest these essential needs. The act of prayer asks of us something and by doing so delivers much in return — it asks us to present ourselves to the unknown as we are, devoid of pretence and affectation, and to contemplate exactly what it is we love or cherish. Through this conversation with our inner self we confront the nature of our own existence.

 The coronavirus has brought us to our knees, yet it has also presented us with the opportunity to be prayerful, whether we believe in God or not. By forcing us into isolation, it has dismantled our constructed selves, by challenging our presumed needs, our desires, and our ambitions and rendered us raw, essential and reflective. Our sudden dislocation has thrown us into a mystery that exists at the edge of tears and revelation, for none of us knows what tomorrow will bring.

 In our hubris we thought we knew, but as we bow our heads within the virus’ awesome power, all we are sure of now is our defencelessness. In the end this vulnerability may be, for our planet and ourselves, our saving grace, as we step chastened into tomorrow. Released from our certitude, we present our purest offering to the world — our prayers.

I can’t shake it. Can’t grasp it. It makes me wince and laugh and then, every time, it makes me cry. I think it might be a masterpiece. Do you like it?

Next Question

I am really loving the new Bob Dylan song Murder Most Foul. I wonder if you’ve heard it and if so what do you think?

Next Question

Do you think that the new Bob Dylan song feels like a swan song? Do you think it is the last song we will hear from him?

Next Question

I am trying to read more poetry lately in isolation. Can you suggest a poet or poem?","Dear Douglas, David, Emilia and Annie,

 Many other people have also written in about Bob Dylan’s new song, ‘Murder Most Foul’ — and the interest is justifiable. It is a perplexing but beautiful song and, like many people, I have been extremely moved by it.

 At the heart of this seventeen-minute epic is a terrible event, the assassination of JFK — a dark vortex that threatens to pull everything into it, just as it did in the USA back in 1963. Whirling around the incident Dylan weaves a litany of loved things — music mostly — that reach into the darkness, in deliverance. As the song unfolds he throws down lifeline after lifeline, insistent and mantra-like, and we are lifted, at least momentarily, free of the event. Dylan’s relentless cascade of song references points to our potential as human beings to create beautiful things, even in the face of our own capacity for malevolence. ‘Murder Most Foul’ reminds us that all is not lost, as the song itself becomes a lifeline thrown into our current predicament.

 The instrumentation is formless and fluid and very beautiful. Lyrically it has all the perverse daring and playfulness of many of Dylan’s great songs, but beyond that there is something within his voice that feels extraordinarily comforting, especially at this moment. It is as though it has travelled a great distance, through stretches of time, full of an earned integrity and stature that soothes in the way of a lullaby, a chant, or a prayer.

 As for whether this is the last time we will hear a new Bob Dylan song. I certainly hope not. But perhaps there is some wisdom in treating all songs, or for that matter, all experiences, with a certain care and reverence, as if encountering these things for the last time. I say this not just in the light of the novel coronavirus, rather that it is an eloquent way to lead one’s life and to appreciate the here and now, by savouring it as if it were for the last time. To have a drink with a friend as if it were the last time, to eat with your family as it were the last time, to read to your child as if it were the last time, or indeed, to sit in the kitchen listening to a new Bob Dylan song as if it were the last time. It permeates all that we do with greater meaning, placing us within the present, our uncertain future, temporarily arrested.

 Annie, I was reading a poem today which very much resonates — it is by the beloved English poet Stevie Smith, who has given me much pleasure over the years.

  

 I Do Not Speak

  

 I do not ask for mercy for understanding for peace

 And in these heavy days I do not ask for release

 I do not ask that suffering shall cease

  

 I do not pray to God to let me die

 To give an ear attentive to my cry

 To pause in his marching and not hurry by

  

 I do not ask for anything I do not speak

 I do not question and I do not seek

 I used to in the day when I was weak

  

 Now I am strong and lapped in sorrow

 As in a coat of magic mail and borrow

 For Time today and care not for tomorrow

Next Question

Have you and the band thought about live streaming a concert at some point? It could really help people feel connected during this time.

Next Question

What does a person who isn’t particularly creative do in isolation? I haven’t got a clue.","Dear Alice, Henry and Saskia,

 My response to a crisis has always been to create. This impulse has saved me many times — when things got bad I’d plan a tour, or write a book, or make a record — I’d hide myself in work, and try to stay one step ahead of whatever it was that was pursuing me. So, when it became clear that The Bad Seeds would have to postpone the European tour and that I would have, at the very least, three months of sudden spare time, my mind jumped into overdrive with ideas of how to fill that space. On a video call with my team we threw ideas around — stream a solo performance from my home, write an isolation album, write an online corona diary, write an apocalyptic film script, create a pandemic playlist on Spotify, start an online reading club, answer Red Hand Files questions live online, stream a songwriting tutorial, or a cooking programme, etc. — all with the aim to keep my creative momentum going, and to give my self-isolating fans something to do.

 That night, as I contemplated these ideas, I began to think about what I had done in the last three months — working with Warren and the Sydney Symphony Orchestra, planning and mounting a massive and incredibly complex Nick Cave exhibition with the Royal Danish Library, putting together the Stranger Than Kindness book, working on an updated edition of my “Collected Lyrics”, developing the show for the Ghosteen world tour (which, by the way, will be fucking mind-blowing if we ever get to do it!), working on a second B Sides and Rarities record and, of course, reading and writing The Red Hand Files. As I sat there in bed and reflected, another thought presented itself, clear and wondrous and humane —

 Why is this the time to get creative?

 Together we have stepped into history and are now living inside an event unprecedented in our lifetime. Every day the news provides us with dizzying information that a few weeks before would have been unthinkable. What deranged and divided us a month ago seems, at best, an embarrassment from an idle and privileged time. We have become eyewitnesses to a catastrophe that we are seeing unfold from the inside out. We are forced to isolate — to be vigilant, to be quiet, to watch and contemplate the possible implosion of our civilisation in real time. When we eventually step clear of this moment we will have discovered things about our leaders, our societal systems, our friends, our enemies and most of all, ourselves. We will know something of our resilience, our capacity for forgiveness, and our mutual vulnerability. Perhaps, it is a time to pay attention, to be mindful, to be observant.

 As an artist, it feels inapt to miss this extraordinary moment. Suddenly, the acts of writing a novel, or a screenplay or a series of songs seem like indulgences from a bygone era. For me, this is not a time to be buried in the business of creating. It is a time to take a backseat and use this opportunity to reflect on exactly what our function is — what we, as artists, are for.

 Saskia, there are other forms of engagement, open to us all. An email to a distant friend, a phone call to a parent or sibling, a kind word to a neighbour, a prayer for those working on the front lines. These simple gestures can bind the world together — throwing threads of love here and there, ultimately connecting us all — so that when we do emerge from this moment we are unified by compassion, humility and a greater dignity. Perhaps, we will also see the world through different eyes, with an awakened reverence for the wondrous thing that it is. This could, indeed, be the truest creative work of all.

89,March 2020,https://www.theredhandfiles.com/what-do-we-do-now,what-do-we-do-now,1,JOHN,LONDON,UK,What do we do now?,"The Red Hand Files has always been a space in which I could offer dubious existential notions, religious meditations, unsound advice, millennial senilities and general annoyances, while hopefully simultaneously extending a little human kindness and compassion. However, these sorts of ruminations came from a more privileged and fortunate time, when we had the oxygen to muse and to play. Things have changed, we are faced with a common enemy — impartial, unfeeling and of immeasurable magnitude — and it is no longer a time for abstractions. Now is the time to be cautious with our words, our opinions.

 A friend called our new world ‘a ghost ship’ — and maybe she is right. She has recently lost someone dear to her and recognises acutely the premonitory feeling of a world about to be shattered — and that we will need to put ourselves back together again, not only personally, but societally. In time we will be given the opportunity to either contract around the old version of ourselves and our world — insular, self-interested and tribalistic — or understand the connectedness and commonality of all humans, everywhere. In isolation, we will be presented with our essence — of what we are personally and what we are as a society. We will be asked to decide what we want to preserve about our world and ourselves, and what we want to discard.

 Eventually these questions will become of acute significance, but they are not for now. Now is a time to listen to those in more informed positions and to follow instructions, as difficult as that may be, as we step into the unprecedented unknowable. We should be careful about the noises we make — especially those with a public voice — and should not pretend to know what we do not. From within the clamour and tonnage of information and misinformation, of opinions and counter-opinions, of blame-games and grim prophecy and the most panic-inducing version of ‘Imagine’ ever recorded, emerges a simple message — wash your hands and (if you can) stay at home.

87,March 2020,https://www.theredhandfiles.com/favourite-moment-the-bible,favourite-moment-the-bible,1,NICCOLÒ,NOVARA,ITALY,What is your favourite moment from the Bible?,"Dear Niccolò,

 When Jesus was taken down from the cross, his body laid in a tomb and a stone rolled across the entrance, his twelve male disciples essentially fled. Mary Magdalene did not. In Matthew 27:61 it says —

 “Mary Magdalene and the other Mary remained standing there in front of the tomb.”

 I think this haunted single sentence is probably my favourite moment from the Bible.

 Misjudged by history, her fundamental importance in the Christian story undermined by the religious patriarchy, Mary Magdalene nevertheless remains the subversive nucleus around which the Gospel story revolves.

 Mary Magdalene is the most moving symbol of true and resilient love, both earthly and spiritual. She ‘remains standing’ at the entrance of the tomb, the primary witness between two monumental events — the crucifixion and the resurrection — that have imprinted themselves upon history and fashioned not just Western thinking but the very essence of what we are, whether we like it or not. Mary Magdalene, forever standing at the mouth of the tomb in steadfast vigil, gazing out of history, is embedded in our subconscious. She is the true icon of feminine grief — complex, elemental, patient, empathetic and full of sorrowing wonder, and a manifestation of both physical and transcendent love — the true human hero of the Christian story.

 These days, some of my songs are feeling a little nervous. They are like children that have been playing cheerfully in the schoolyard, only to be told that all along they have had some hideous physical deformity. Their little hearts sink and they piss their pants. They leave the playground burning with shame, as a scornful, self-righteous future turns around with its stone and takes aim.

 But what songwriter could have predicted thirty years ago that the future would lose its sense of humour, its sense of playfulness, its sense of context, nuance and irony, and fall into the hands of a perpetually pissed off coterie of pearl-clutchers? How were we to know? 

 Perhaps we writers should have been more careful with our words – I can own this, and I may even agree – however, we should never blame the songs themselves. Songs are divinely constituted organisms. They have their own integrity. As flawed as they may be, the souls of the songs must be protected at all costs. They must be allowed to exist in all their aberrant horror, unmolested by these strident advocates of the innocuous, even if just as some indication that the world has moved toward a better, fairer and more sensitive place. If punishment must be administered, punish the creators, not the songs. We can handle it. I would rather be remembered for writing something that was discomforting or offensive, than to be forgotten for writing something bloodless and bland.

I just want to express my gratitude for ‘Girl in Amber’. I have never really felt anything which expressed my feelings about the death of my daughter, but this song does somehow. It has had a cathartic and necessary effect on me for which I am thankful.","Dear Joscha, Kevin, Somebody, Samantha and Liz,

 ‘Girl in Amber’ is a song wrapped around a mystery. It is a song that formed itself as if from a dream and it seems to possess a special, almost mystical, power.

 Back in 2014, I was sitting at Warren’s kitchen table after a day of making music in his little studio at the back of his house in Paris. On the table was a paperweight with a spider trapped inside, and the title ‘Girl in Amber’ slipped into my mind. I remember feeling happy, because I rarely get given titles for songs — the title almost always comes after a long struggle with the words — and this one seemed alive with meaning. It made me think of people I knew who were in a state of stasis, forever locked in the past, but it was not about anyone in particular. Or so I thought.

 I recorded a version of the song that day, improvising the repetitive, mantra-like lyric, and then forgot about it.

 ***

 A year or so later, I was in another studio in Paris attempting to finish Skeleton Tree. Things had changed. Arthur, my son, had died a few months earlier and I was existing in a kind of fugue-state, numbly sitting in the studio listening to the songs, trying to make sense of the material we had been working on over the last year, and as I listened to the version of ‘Girl in Amber’, I was completely overwhelmed by what I heard.

 It was suddenly and tragically clear that ‘Girl in Amber’ had found its ‘who’. The ‘who’ was Susie, my wife — held impossibly, as she was at the time, within her grief, reliving each day a relentless spinning song that began with the ringing of the phone and ended with the collapse of her world. The eerie, death-obsessed second verse seemed to speak directly to me, and I added the half-line ‘Your little blue-eyed boy’, but left the rest of the verse as it was. There were a couple of lines in the song that made little sense, but I left them unchanged for they brought a fractured inarticulateness to the lyric, which added to its mysterious, emotional pull. I added the line ‘Don’t touch me’ in the mixing session some months later. It felt true.

 In 1998, I wrote in a lecture called The Secret Life of the Love Song about the strange, second sight that certain songs seemed to have, and certainly there are a number of songs on Skeleton Tree that appeared to speak into the future, but nothing as acutely and tragically as ‘Girl in Amber’. ‘Girl in Amber’ seemed to possess an uncanny clairvoyance, a secret intelligence — the song was already deep in mourning before the tragedy had occurred.

 When I sang ‘Girl in Amber’ on the Skeleton Tree tour, it felt very much as if I was singing into the terrible present — my wife still trapped in the amber of her grief. Last month I performed it on the In Conversation tour. Three years had gone by and it struck me as I sang it, alone at the piano, that I was speaking to the past, and that Susie had been released, at least in part, from the suffocating darkness that surrounded her. There was some air and some light between her and the world. Time had done its work.

 Liz, I would like to think that ‘Girl in Amber’ went some way toward releasing both my wife and me from the paralysis of our grief, as you suggest it helped you. I would also add that it has been my experience that although we are all, in some way or another, imprisoned by the events of our seemingly intractable pasts, in time, patient time, we heal.

And I hope that someday artists raise their voice for their fans in oppressed countries rather than banning concerts somewhere! Your biggest fan, from distant skies!","Dear Sadegh,

 Some years ago my dear friend, Arash from Tehran sent me a link to the movie, No One Knows About Persian Cats. This has to be one of the great rock ‘n’ roll movies of all time. Courageous, funny, dangerous, heart-breaking yet ultimately uplifting, it shows, as clear as any movie I can think of, the pure subversive force of rock ‘n’ roll, its incredible resilience, its unifying power and its transcendent nature. The extraordinary lengths the musicians go to in order to play their music, despite the grotesque and repressive nature of the regime, is truly inspiring.

 I receive a lot of letters from Iran on The Red Hand Files and it is a genuine sadness for us that we are unable to play in your country. I hope one day that will change. There appears to be an ever-growing hunger in Iran to resist these oppressive measures and stand up for basic freedoms, artistic or otherwise. I wish you all the best in that struggle.

 Of course, there are paternalistic and authoritarian forces that exist everywhere, to a greater or lesser degree; these come in a variety of different guises, always in the name of some greater virtue, yet always with the same intent — to silence musicians and free expression. We must, of course, resist.

 The good news, however, is that it looks like The Bad Seeds will be playing in Istanbul next year, and if it is anything like the show we did there in 2018, it’s going to be a blast. It was a special time for us. Email me your address, Sadegh, and we can arrange tickets for the show. The Bad Seeds and I will be happy to see you, although it is sad you have to come so far.

Next Question

What makes a great song?","Dear Lataban and Mila,

 It seems to me that many of the great artists, especially in music, appear to possess a wildly conflicted sense of themselves, yet persistently pursue their own uniqueness, even when it runs at odds with the orthodoxies of the day. They tend to be outliers, abyss-gazers and misfits, whose sense of isolation is further amplified by their notoriety, and who use their art as a way of connecting to people and legitimising their own strangeness. They understand, on some level, that it is the nature of their vocation to steal across the borders of convention, collect up ideas and bring them back to the world. This requires a certain reckless spirit and it may be that some spend too long on the other side and that it becomes difficult for them to return. However, whether any of this is actual mental illness, I don’t know. This term feels too elastic, too nebulous to comment.

 Whether being hurt is a necessary requirement to creativity is only true in so much as to live is partly to suffer. You cannot create without suffering, because you cannot live without suffering. One of the jobs of a songwriter, as I see it, is to develop strategies to help people transcend their sorrows. This is the unique duality of a great song – that it can reflect back at the listener the extent of their own hurt, yet lift them beyond it at the same time. How often have we wept ourselves to transcendence through music?

 Part of the process for the songwriter is to stay alert to the nature of their own wounds without indulging them, to gravitate towards happiness when possible, to venture beyond convention and acceptability without losing oneself, to understand that our most treasured beliefs exist on the far side of what we think we know, and to go there cautiously, yet fearlessly and, perhaps most importantly of all, to remember to return.

I’m currently (and have been for the past 9 years) emulating your rock n’ roll persona in a Nick Cave tribute band. I dress up like you (a cheap version, no stylist, can’t find a shirt like yours) and in a shamanistic way recreate your live performances, sometimes succeeding to trick the audience into a feeling of being nearer to you. I’m sorry if you feel I am a vampire sucking on you, but I’m not ready to “do my own thing”.

 I was not familiar with the Cave Dogs, I am afraid, but having watched you on YouTube, I have this to say — you sound fucking terrifyingly like me. You have even perfected my peculiar relationship with the Gods of Intonation. In fact, when I was playing it Susie, my wife, walked in the room with her arms full of dresses and fabric swatches and said, “Wo! Babe, you’re sounding good.” And I’m like, “Thanks. It’s not me. It’s a Serbian imposter.” And she says, “Oh, sorry,” and walks out again. So, you are obviously doing something right. But you are also correct to suggest you don’t have the right shirt. If you send me your email address, I’ll send you one of my old ones and a suit — I have many — or a hit squad. I’m not sure which.

Next Question

Do you like Kanye?","Dear Math and Naja,

 We love and respect our fans, both past and present, but, of course, they are free to come and go as they please. What The Bad Seeds are trying to do is to nurture our listeners, to challenge and confront them, to make records that create some kind of dissonance, and perhaps even disturb them, but hopefully ultimately move them.

 Losing fans is the collateral damage that comes from engaging in music from an artistic perspective, rather than a commercial one. Making music specifically to please fans can be patronising and exploitative. Challenging music, by its very nature, alienates some fans whilst inspiring others, but without that dissonance, there is no conversation, there is no risk, there are no tears and there are no smiles, and nobody is moved and nobody is affected!

 For some of us, moments of genuine emotional resonance are rare; we are besieged by insincere forces and have become cynical and suspicious of the world. Many letters to The Red Hand Files signal a despair and anger toward the way the world operates, but they also display a deep love of beauty and a need for meaning. We want to make records that do not add to the hollow clamour that surrounds us but instead challenge people and guide them toward meaning. As I’ve said before, how we achieve this is, to an extent, out of our hands. As a band, we can only move toward what stirs us and this generally exists within the unfamiliar and unconventional. In this place, we are challenged, even unnerved, but ultimately rewarded and we hope that our fans are too.

 With each new record, almost inevitably some fans will move on. I can only say that I am truly grateful to have been a part of their journey, and that they have been part of ours. In the end, to challenge our fans is to love them, even if it means losing them.

 *** 

 Making art is a form of madness – we slip deep within our own singular vision and become lost to it. There is no musician on Earth that is as committed to their own derangement as Kanye, and in this respect, at this point in time, he is our greatest artist.

It’s one of the most powerful pieces of music I’ve ever heard, and I want to know everything you can tell me.

Next Question

Do you think that your songs tell the future?","Dear Jon and Susan,

 At around 8’ 30’’ into the song ‘Hollywood’ the narrator stands on the beach, looking out to sea. Malibu is on fire and the animals have been driven down from the hills to the shore. A sea serpent rises out of the ocean. A small boy drops his bucket and spade and climbs into the sun. Jon, this series of images came to me while in the back of a car driving around your city of Oslo on the last Bad Seeds’ tour, and was the first step toward the writing of Ghosteen. Within this sudden vision the whole of the album presented itself. It is rare in songwriting to be given such a rich and sustaining gift.

 Some months later I wrote what would become the second verse of ‘Hollywood’ – the image of my wife, as a white cougar with ‘a terrible engine of wrath for a heart’, roaming the Hollywood Hills. This single image of rage-filled, carnivorous grief sat in my notebook waiting for a home.

 The Buddhist story of Kisa and the Mustard Seed, that would eventually be the final part of ‘Hollywood’, had been of great significance and comfort to me for years and at some point I jotted it down in verse form, completely independent of anything else, and with no intention of it being a song.

 ***

 Early in 2018, at the initial ‘improv’ recording sessions in Brighton, Warren threw down the driving ‘Hollywood’ loop and at the same time played the beautiful circular synth chords. Meanwhile, I sat jamming at the piano and dumping lyrics onto it. I had all these disparate images rolling around in my head, unmoored and desperate for a home – Malibu on fire, the cougar roaming the hills, the terrified animals on the shore, the breaching leviathan, the kid and the sun, Kisa and her baby – and the restless propulsion of the loop allowed me to just spill them out. I didn’t at the time know what they meant, or how they connected to each other. We played non-stop for hours, lost to it.

 Listening back, in the studio a week or so later, most of the extended jam was unusable, but there was a fifteen minute section, towards the end, that was mysterious and compelling and so we edited it out and kept it. It included within it the cougar scene, the beach and the fire, and the Kisa story. The remainder of the lyrics were there as well, extemporized yet complete. We added some strings, backing vocals, Tommy’s beautiful drumming, tidied up the vocal a bit and it became ‘Hollywood.’ It was effortless and enigmatic and it spoke to us from another place, crying from the future whilst calling from the past.

 ***

 In the song ‘Ghosteen’, a man is saying goodbye to a sleeping woman – he is leaving, heading somewhere, we don’t know where. ‘Hollywood’ is a continuation of this song. It is the leaving, the driving away, heading out of LA, along the Pacific Coast to Malibu. Malibu is on fire.

 We recorded most of the record at Woodshed Studios, in Malibu, later in 2018, in a single recording room surrounded by an Eden-like garden. The control desk was inside the room, so visiting musicians, friends and dogs all sat in the same room in which we recorded. Warren and I stayed at the house attached to the studio, perched on the valley hill, and it was an extraordinarily intense and magical time for both of us. A few weeks after we left the studio, the Malibu fires swept through the area. The studio itself remained mysteriously unharmed, but the house, the beautiful garden, and the surrounding homes were incinerated. It was devastating for us all. The studio is now back up and running and will always hold a very special place in our hearts.

 ***

 Susan, the idea that songs are prophetic is the kind of magical thinking which I would normally reject, but there has been too much coincidence, too often, not to feel that some songs perhaps hold a certain unsettling knowledge, beyond the understanding of their creators. I suspect we all have intimations or intuitions, that are holding conversations with the future, but that we tend to disregard, perhaps at our peril. As songwriters we are given scraps of information – images, visions, projections, divination – that become the building blocks for songs; these uncanny hunches are the stuff we work with, the material with which we create, so the songs end up feeling elastic, stretching themselves forward in time and back into the past. They can feel like preternatural witnesses to things yet to come, signallers calling urgently from an emergency – the future – while haunted by what has gone before.

 And now, as we watch Australia burn, no such indicators are necessary. As Carl from Belgium says, in a letter to ‘The Red Hand Files’ “the Australian fires are a global torch illuminating the human condition. Nature, on its knees, is a dangerous beast”. The future, it seems, is here.

 Sending love, Nick

How do you celebrate Christmas?

Next Question

I read today that when a photon is born in the Sun, it take it 1,000,000 years to come to the Sun’s surface (it’s colliding with other particles and constantly changes its direction). And then a further few minutes to reach the Earth. Something that is so ordinary as the sunlight appears to have its own, very ancient history. “We are photons released from a dying star”. It’s so great we’ve got the chance to take part in this cosmic spectacle and that we can consciously contemplate it, don’t you think?","Dear Tim, Joshua and M,

 Christmas to me is the remnant of an evaporating culture to which I once belonged. I am not a Christian, yet I am attached to its culture, personally, nostalgically and sentimentally. It is not the only culture available, there are others, equally valid or invalid, both religious and secular. But, for me, as someone who grew up in an Anglican home, sang in the cathedral choir, and has an enduring fascination with the Christian scriptures, the Christian story, in all its quaintness and implausibility, holds great meaning. Christ continues to move through my imagination, a vaporous ghost beckoning from the shadows, and his story affects me deeply. Jesus is an absurdity that rises eerily from my yearning for spiritual comfort, within a cosmos I cannot begin to understand.

 And M, I can’t agree with you more. The fascination of the universe is a wonder so monumental that we are left dizzy with awe as we attempt to contemplate it. Infinity lives on the far side of language, touching only the fringes of our understanding, and I admire those who devote their lives to the investigation of this impossibility.

 As stars are born and die, the phenomena of suffering and love are projected onto Earth to play out in the seeming inconsequentiality of our human lives. We are the broken metaphors of a cosmos that is beyond our comprehension. 

 Christ is a symbol of our imperfect and limited attempt at understanding eternity, and addresses the vulnerability of humanity itself. Perhaps we should not look at the Christian story as a symbol of our naivety or ignorance, but instead cherish it as our attempt to comprehend the incomprehensible.

 So, Tim and Joshua, as Christianity retreats back into the churches and cathedrals, as all conspicuous notions of Christ fade from our culture, and Christmas becomes the sole province of a roly-poly man in a Coca-Cola red suit (whose days may also be numbered) I will visit a church this Christmas; I will kneel before the fading vestiges of an outmoded idea called spiritual transcendence and our beautiful and moving attempt to humanise the ecstatic cosmic drama, and I will pray.

Next Question

Have you ever reached the same highs when sober as when you were on some sort of lovely substance?","Dear Serge and Craig,

 My song ‘Deanna’ is a collision of dissonant imagery, beautiful transgressions, reckless theatrics, secret admissions, impossible lusts, erroneous politics and fuck you swaggering, that ultimately resolves itself into a pure expression of the monstrous rapture of youth. It represents a time of joyful and wilful abandon, into drugs, into music, into danger, into love, into life itself. Like love, the song cannot be broken down into its respective parts without doing a grave injustice to its mystery and its glory. ‘Deanna’ is a capsule of incautious adoration that alerts us to the futility of judging the actions of our past through the lens of what we have become, no matter how much wiser, more aware and insightful we think we are. As an old guy, I probably have no right to sing it, yet I do as ‘Deanna’ holds a special place in my heart and it propels me back to a fearless and less fractured time. It remains “a song that yearns to be sung.”

  

 No carpet on the floor

 And the winding cloth holds many moths

 Around your Ku Klux furniture

 I come a death’s head in your frock

  

 As for your question, Serge, Deanna’s mother was American and each Christmas she would leave Melbourne and head back to the U.S. for the holidays, leaving her maverick daughter in charge of the house that sat high up on the south bank of the Yarra River. Perhaps anticipating our behaviour, her mother covered the furniture in the living room with protective white sheets—the Ku Klux furniture, we called it.

 What happened to Deanna? I’m not really sure. She went to live in the States, and we lost touch. But for me she lives inside the song, imprisoned there, just as I am in all my songs, and that is the melancholy beauty of them; songs become a form of entrapment—you write one and then throw away the key.

 Craig, I’m not sure if I have quite reached the same highs as those times while sober, but then again I also haven’t reached the kind of lows that eventually came with taking those ‘lovely substances’— bashed up in police stations, dehumanised in rehabs, near-death experiences, suicidal thoughts, routine overdoses, reduced motivation, broken bones, being ripped off, liking Charles Bukowski, social and physical anhedonia, herd mentality, dead friends, fucked up relationships, abscesses, car accidents, psychosis, reading The Hobbit, malnutrition, creative impotence, epic time-wasting, singing flat (still working on that), talking shit (still working on that too), life-threatening diseases, and not ringing my mother on her birthday.

I’ve always seen you as something of an underrated humourist. Do you see comedy as an essential art form?

Next Question

How important is humour to you in your art?

Next Question

Who in your band is the funniest?","Dear Chris, Luke, Alex and Bradley,

 There is nothing on this earth that is so serious that it cannot be elevated by humour. Humour is not lack of gravity and it is not frivolity. Rather, it is the merciful oxygen that can envelop seriousness and prevent it from becoming a grim contagion that infects ourselves and those around us. True humour is the antidote to dogmatism and fanaticism, and we must be cautious of the humourless and those who cannot take a joke.

 Humour is the way in which we manoeuvre ourselves through the things that are difficult to talk about, that require subtlety of thought, that are counter-intuitive, uncertain and mysterious. Humour is a way of exploring the uncomfortable without fully committing ourselves, testing and pushing at the boundaries of acceptability, always able to retreat back into the form itself.

 In this respect, Luke, I am a humourist, and many of my songs are essentially comic songs. I have always used humour as a way of presenting ideas that may otherwise be considered unacceptable. Humour is a device that allows us to push against the constraints of decorum and say the uncomfortable things that challenge our presumptions; it allows us room to breathe.

 It is for this reason, Chris, that I have such deep admiration for comedians, from Buster Keaton to Lenny Bruce to Dave Chappelle. Anarchic and troublesome, comedians are the canaries in the coal mine of ideas, often saying things that cannot safely be said elsewhere and taking significant personal risk to speak truth, not just to power, but to stupidity too, to outrage and self-righteousness. Between the joke and the laughter resides our common humanity and as our laughing bodies relax, our hearts and minds open and serious ideas can penetrate. Humour is the Trojan horse that crosses the moat and infiltrates the castle, bringing with it the unsayable.

 Ultimately, humour allows us to laugh at ourselves and the absurdity of our human predicament. Humour tells us that we are, in the greater scheme of things, both completely meaningless and supremely meaningful, and though our efforts are of no real consequence, they are heroic and deeply moving.

 Love, Nick

You have written exquisitely on the subject, and I have found great comfort in your words, and have great empathy for you and your family’s devastating loss of your precious son.

My mom was murdered with an AR-15 by a white supremacist in our synagogue, killed because this 19-year-old felt Jews were ‘destroying’ the white race. It has been almost 8 months, I stopped counting out of numbness, and I still don’t have anger towards the shooter, but more so for people who my mother was close to, and in her death, claimed my mother as their own, and exploited the situation for their own gain. I am afraid to let go of the anger, because I feel it connects me to my mother, and to the tragedy where she died, my last experience with her. I am afraid to move forward in any way. Family members are grieving in a different way than I am and that makes things even more uncomfortable. I am afraid to connect or feel my mother’s spirit in any way.

Do you have any advice on these components of grief: the anger; the fear.

With utmost gratitude towards your input,","Dear Hannah,

 This is a very difficult question to answer, there are no adequate words and I worry that I will not do the enormity of the tragedy of your mother’s death justice, or your grief, for that matter. I apologise if I fall short. I cannot claim to understand the complexities of your situation, but although the circumstances are very different, I do understand about dealing with a death that is in the public eye and the deranging internal conflicts that it can bring.

 The tragedy of my son’s death is inscribed into the collective consciousness of the town where we live and where he died. I have had to learn to share the reality of his passing with the town itself, because it affected us all. I doubt there was a mother in Brighton who did not feel a chill of horror and cling to her own children a little tighter upon hearing the news of Arthur’s senseless accident. But Arthur was our child, our own flesh and blood; Susie and I didn’t want to share him with anyone, and we were deeply possessive over his absence. It took us some time to understand that while he belonged to us, he belonged to the world too. In time we understood that, although we were the ultimate custodians of Arthur’s memory, he was, in fact, mourned by many, and many people felt outraged at the cruelty and randomness of the event, just as we did. Susie and I, individually and together, had to find a way to be with Arthur, but also to share him with a multitude.

 In time we found a place away from the concerns of the world and our own conflicted feelings, that was silent and vast, where we could have the necessary and ongoing conversation with our son, to tell him that we loved him, and that we missed him, and that we were sorry. We found a place where we can be with him, in grief, beyond the glare and the noise of the world, a place of meaning.

 Hannah, your tragedy was not an accident, nor a random act of fate, and this incident was an egregious affront to both your community and our collective humanity. Your mother was your mother, but she was also a Jew, and along with other members of her community simply doing the thing that observant Jews have always done on a Saturday morning. How difficult it must be for you to untangle this and find that silent space where you can speak with your mother, as her daughter, and be heard above the tumult of other people’s expectations, the various agendas of the media, your own rage and the enormity of the act itself. How can you find your own meaning in your mother’s passing?

 It feels to me, that the meaning exists within the anger. Not only is your anger justified, it is compassionate and essential and, as you said, connects you to your mother, even as those around you take possession of her, eclipsing your feelings with their own needs. The righteous energy of your anger is the flaming sword you hold above your mother’s memory. It may be the very thing that protects her, shielding her from the suffocating demands of the world. Perhaps, at this time, your anger is a way of safekeeping the spirit of your mother, of caring for her, of seeking her, of calling her to you. It is a pure and holy anger.

 But there is another place too, a quieter place that patiently awaits you, and maybe in time you will find a moment to temporarily lay down the sword and, speaking into the sacred silence, talk to your mother, in grief, in longing, and in her presence, and perhaps find some solace there. I very much hope so.

In fact I don’t think I’ve ever heard a more uplifting, jubilant record before. When I listened to it the first time alone, I was brought to tears. And when I listened to it again with my friend, both of us sitting in the car in complete silence, we both felt moved by its brightness and gentle optimism. Why do you think people are reacting so differently to it? I almost feel like I’ve misinterpreted it.

Next Question

Ghosteen seems haunted. Is it?

Next Question

Where did the drums go?","Dear Jonah, Amber and Kjell,

 I am very happy to hear you describe Ghosteen as uplifting and jubilant, Jonah. This was certainly the Bad Seeds’ objective when we made the record. We wanted each song to feel as if it were climbing toward an exultant and euphoric state, for the record to be a vessel that transported the listener far away from the world and its troubles, and that it lived in the jubilant and hopeful beyond.

 If there is sadness in Ghosteen, perhaps it is the recognition that we are often blind to the splendour of the world and indifferent to its attendant wonder. Perhaps the sadness is the recognition that the world is indeed beautiful, that it spins within the palm of our own hands and its beauty is available to all, if only we had eyes to see.

 And maybe, Amber, you are right and Ghosteen is haunted. Perhaps the songs became a kind of free-floating conversation with the spirit world, buoyed up by the absence of the ones we love. Perhaps the ghostly forms of the departed are all around us, magnetised toward the act of creation. Perhaps they see that to be alive and upon the earth, at this time and against all the odds, is the most rare and coveted of things, and to be making art such a singular and fortuitous privilege, that they just wanted to come along for the ride. In the song Ghosteen, baby bear goes to the moon in a boat; Ghosteen is that boat, as it sails through the dark to the stars, a galleon ship collecting fireflies and spirit-children as it goes. At times Ghosteen may feel unmoored and homeless, but it is pointed firmly toward paradise, the crew is joyous, the world smiles, and the sun bursts over the edge of the earth.

 ***

 Kjell, to answer your question, Thomas Wydler, our drummer, did some amazing work on this record, however, after a great deal of thought, we all felt that the drums anchored the songs to the ground and didn’t allow them to float. The decision was not made lightly or on a whim, rather it was a tough artistic decision determined by the needs of the songs themselves. Although there is little drumming on the first part of Ghosteen, Tommy’s absence is courageous and monumental and gives the record its amorphous sound. He is the very best there is.

 The decision as to what sort of record we make is largely out of our hands. We have no ‘intentions’ beyond meaning itself. The record must mean something, right? What more can we ask? The form that that expression of meaning comes in is, to some degree, beside the point. We are slaves to manifest meaning and masters to nothing at all.

After all, Billy Dilly was presumably still slobbering on his head when Stag opened fire. Thanks for taking the time to consider this question.","Dear Slim Lee,

 During my more gloomy moments I sometimes wonder if anyone actually listens to my lyrics, and whether the enormous amount of work I put into them may in fact go unheeded. So it was with very real gratitude that I read this question, as you had clearly reflected long and hard on the matter. I am very moved, to be honest. On my knees, I thank you (but not in that way).

 I didn’t even have to look at the address of this question to know that you were from Melbourne. We Melburnians are warped but meticulous thinkers and, I would tentatively suggest, a step ahead of everyone else. Our minds simply jump the leash and run, unchecked and slavering, where others fear to tread.

 It did occur to me one night, as I performed Stagger Lee in full priapic flight, that Stagger Lee does not shoot Billy Dilly with an actual gun at all, but that his being “filled full of lead. Bang! Bang! Bang!” was simply a metaphor for the force of Stag’s ejaculation, and Blixa’s terrifying and inhuman screeching at the end orgasmic in nature. This made me wonder, chillingly at the time, what sleeping with Blixa must be like – something I am sadly unable to elaborate on.

 Beyond that, my friend, I have nothing more to add, but if any more theories about my songs work their way into your beautiful mind, perhaps on one of those warm and eerie Melbourne nights, where the fruit bats fly from tree to tree, please do not hesitate to write in and tell me.

 Thank you for writing, I completely appreciate your points. As far as I am aware the TM organisation has a scaling system depending on what you are able to pay and your individual circumstances. Regardless, you are right TM is not free of charge and you will have to pay something.

 I did not mean to discount other practices of meditation; there is an excellent app called Waking Up, where Sam Harris guides you through ten-minute Mindfulness meditations. Sam operates a refund system if you don’t find the introductory course valuable, additionally, if you would like to use his app but genuinely cannot afford it, he is happy to consider free access. Waking Up requires little commitment time-wise, yet is incredibly effective. I use it often, in conjunction with TM.

 While I endorse meditation, I also understand the practice may not be for everyone. However, if you are interested there are various types of meditation and numerous apps and courses out there.

Next Question

Do you practice meditation?","Dear Maia and Matthais,

 The filmmaker, David Lynch, described the practice of Transcendental Meditation as catching the big fish. I read that he has been practising it since he had a breakdown around the time of making Eraserhead, over forty years ago. He claims he has never missed a meditation. If that is true, I am greatly impressed. The basics of TM are taught during a three session course, at the end of which your teacher gives you a personal mantra. Anyone can do it. It is effortless and there is nothing to get right or wrong. I have been practicing for around six years and found it to be instantly and radically beneficial. So, to answer your question, Maia, from the first time I meditated, I stopped fearing the end of the world.

 I found that it also helps with low-level anger, uncommunicativeness, resentments, impatience, passive-aggression, depression, self-obsession, hatred of the world, blaming others, wanting to murder and maim people and a host of other maladies that I had been dragging around and allowing to define me. Meditation modulated my calamitous internal thinking, and the freaked-out tyrant residing in my head that represented the worst possible version of myself was largely deposed.

 I also found those big fish down there in the depths, the deep creative ideas which David Lynch talks about, wild, bright and thrilling; but more importantly, I found a fundamental understanding of the next right thing to do, of making the choice of the least destructive course of action.

 Unlike some meditation techniques that focus on a life lived entirely within the present moment, Transcendental Meditation seems to radiate backwards and forwards in time, evoking our common humanity and our deep connection to the earth’s inheritance, as it layers us in meaning. It may not hold back the end of the world, but it reduces the element of fear, allowing us to administer to the world more effectively. TM also implements a kind of mysterious reinstating of the soul, a honeying of life, a merciful acceptance of suffering, and reminds us of the incredible privilege it is to be alive.

Next Question

What was your first date with your wife like?","Dear Daniel,

 Shyness is the tentative sound of the orchestra tuning up before the symphony begins. It is a beautiful, fractured piece of music in itself. It is the orchestra attempting to find its shared intent and is over all too quickly if you ask me.

 In some circumstances shyness never finds its harmonic agreement and the situation will never be in tune. Yet shyness is a gift that can also be the sometimes crippling, often overpowering, intuition that the next thing life presents is potentially momentous, be it beautiful or devastating, where an exchanged few words or a gesture is a gateway to a new and unknown world. From these intimations of excruciating clarity, we can fall through our shyness into moments of earth-shaking significance, and our lives can change completely.

 My wife, Susie, has a hummingbird shyness. In social situations she displays herself for a magical, weightless moment then darts away. It is as if she is so acutely tuned into the inherent discomfort of others, whether they display it or not, that the situation becomes overwhelming. She is a rare thing, an exhibitionist that hates to be seen.

 My initial dinner ‘date’ with Susie was an awkward and hesitant affair because we both intuited, on some deep level, that we stood at the threshold of another life that would stretch on indefinitely into the future. We did not know what that life would be, and it was undeclared between us, but our mutual shyness was the orchestra tuning up, with its flutters and discords, as it tried to find its shared melodic objective. In the end, I did what was a potentially life-deranging act and lunged hideously and impulsively through the membrane of our mutual shyness, grabbed my future wife and kissed her. She responded in kind and our shyness dropped away and, well, the symphony began. Shyness became the firewall through which we walked to a strange and different world, and here we are, together.

Next Question

What are your political leanings, in a broad way?

Next Question

How ‘woke’ are you?","Dear Will, Snorri and Stella,

 One of the reasons I write is because it allows me the freedom to move beyond the declared world into the uncanny and unfamiliar world. As a songwriter I have made a commitment to uncertainty and to embrace that which I do not know, because I feel this is where true meaning exists. It allows me to write songs that have within them the spirit of enquiry and reciprocity. It leaves me open to chance, a sense of open-ended potentiality, and fills me with a devotion to the mystery of the world with its deep oceans and dark forests. This notion of uncertainty, of doubt, contains an enormous amount of creative power and is always accompanied by a state of yearning for something beyond certitude, beyond comprehension. My songs are essentially religious songs in that they hold within them a condition of longing for some approximation of Godliness.

 But organised religion itself poses a huge problem for me. Even though it would be so much easier to doze off in the arms of a mutually decided truth, I find that, in most cases, structured systems of faith are specifically designed to switch off the apparatus of inquiry by presenting themselves as the ‘one true religion’. As a consequence, I am left feeling bored and cornered by the hubris of their own sureness.

 I have always found great motivating energy in the idea that the thing I live my life yearning for, let’s call it God, in all probability does not exist. I feel my songs are conversations with the divine that might, in the end, be simply the babblings of a madman talking to himself. It is this thrilling uncertainty, this absurdity, from which all of my songs flow, and more than that, it is the way I live my life.

 So, for me, Stella, living in a state of enquiry, neutrality and uncertainty, beyond dogma and grand conviction, is good for the business of songwriting, and for my life in general. This is the reason I tend to become uncomfortable around all ideologies that brand themselves as ‘the truth’ or ‘the way’. This not only includes most religions, but also atheism, radical bi-partisan politics or any system of thought, including ‘woke’ culture, that finds its energy in self-righteous belief and the suppression of contrary systems of thought. Regardless of the virtuous intentions of many woke issues, it is its lack of humility and the paternalistic and doctrinal sureness of its claims that repel me.

 Antifa and the Far Right, for example, with their routine street fights, role-playing and dress-ups are participants in a weirdly erotic, violent and mutually self-sustaining marriage, propped up entirely by the blind, inflexible convictions of each other’s belief systems. It is good for nothing, except inflaming their own self-righteousness. The New Atheists and their devout opponents are engaged in the same dynamic. Wokeness, for all its virtues, is an ideology immune to the slightest suggestion that in a generation’s time their implacable beliefs will appear as outmoded and fallacious as those of their own former generation. This may well be the engine of progress, but history has a habit of embarrassing our treasured beliefs. Some of us, for example, are of the generation that believed that free speech was a clear-cut and uncontested virtue, yet within a generation this concept is seen by many as a dog-whistle to the Far Right, and is rapidly being consigned to the Left’s ever-expanding ideological junk pile.

 This is not to suggest we should not have our convictions or, indeed, that we should not be angry with the state of the world, or that we should not fight in order to correct the injustices committed against it. Conviction and anger can be the most powerful expressions of universal love. However, my duty as a songwriter is not to try to save the world, but rather to save the soul of the world. This requires me to live my life on the other side of truth, beyond conviction and within uncertainty, where things make less sense, absurdity is a virtue and art rages and burns; where dogma is anathema, discourse is essential, doubt is an energy, magical thinking is not a crime and where possibility and potentiality rule. The answers to the secrets of the heart may just be there, in the inscrutable dark of the forest, in the unfathomable depths of the sea, at the uncertain tips of our fingers.

I feel like everyone is better than me, even though I did very important things for being just 16 years old. How should I behave? What should I do for myself? Thank you for the possible answer.","Dear Barbara,

 Thank you so much for entrusting me with such a courageous and heartfelt question. I took the liberty of discussing it with a number of my female friends and there was not one among them that was not greatly affected by your honesty and that did not understand exactly what you were talking about. It seems that you are not alone in finding the mirror your enemy, but you are unique in being so open and truthful about your relation to it.

 For me, the question took me back to my adolescence and the troubled relationship I had with my own reflected image, and those nightmarish teenage years lived inside the pitiless mirror. I’m afraid to say this constant self-evaluation does not significantly decrease as you grow older, however it does become more manageable. I live mostly in hotels these days, and as I cautiously enter a different bathroom each night, with its angled mirrors and merciless lighting, I stand before the mirror at my most defenceless and exposed, and watch it do its worst. I often wonder how much accumulated misery a hotel mirror contains as it reflects back at us what appears to be our essential self. But, of course, what the mirror projects is not our true self at all but only our reflected outer-shell. What is virtually impossible to see within a mirror is that the very essence of our humanness, our vulnerability and fragility, is the most beautiful thing we possess.

 Yet, when we are young that vulnerability can appear to us as shame or weakness, as we attempt to brace ourselves against what we may see as a brutal, unforgiving and judgemental world. But those who have no awareness of their own fragility, who present themselves as overconfident, armoured-up and invulnerable, sacrifice the essence of what makes them both human and beautiful.

 Vulnerability is the very thing that permits us to connect with each other, to recognise in others the same discomfort they have with themselves and with their place in the world. Vulnerability is the engine of compassion, and can be a superpower, a special vision that allows us to see the quivering, wounded inner world that most of us possess.

 Barbara, I am happy to hear that you have done important things as a 16 year old, because it is often what we do that moves our attention away from what we think we are, or the way that we think we look. The note of pride in your words could be the very thing that escorts you home, where you fall back through the reflected surface of your body, into your authentic self. Your pain-filled question holds great hope because in order to connect meaningfully with the world we need to have some understanding of its innate tragedy. Paradoxically, the fragility of your question is its immense strength and says something very profound about you as a person; something very beautiful shines through its unhappy words. That body that you ‘can’t see anything positive in’ holds within it an unusually courageous, honest and intelligent heart. Your question is a testament to your specialness, and by asking it you have touched us all.

 Finally, you asked what you could do, how to behave. Please, take care of yourself. Seek out beautiful things, inspirations, connections and validating friends. Perhaps you could keep a journal and write stuff down. The written word can put to rest many imagined demons. Identify things that concern you in the world and make incremental efforts to remedy them. At all costs, try to cultivate a sense of humour. See things through that courageous heart of yours. Be merciful to yourself. Be kind to yourself. Be kind.

Next Question

How do we say goodbye?","Dear Robin and Else,

 There is always a temptation to take the position that one has no regrets. There is a death row defiance to this notion that stares down the accusations of the past and says, ‘I am what I am and be damned’. We feel that to harbour regrets dishonours the very place to which we have arrived. But, it can be helpful to remind ourselves that these regrets are intimations informing us that we have developed sufficiently to perceive the nature of our past shortcomings. Regret can be a sorrowing hope that sees the faults of the past through the more lucid and open eyes of the present. They are growing pains as we become better at being ourselves. Most of our past mistakes are consistent with our personal evolution at that time, and the waves of regret simply signal a progression and expansion of our hearts.

 Perhaps it is useful to see our lives as a series of failed or abandoned dreams, but to also recognise that these dreams are the very architecture of our humanity; to lovingly accept our shortcomings and lay them to rest in the knowledge that growth and regret go hand in hand, as do failure and potentiality.

 Many of the regrets I have today seem to revolve around my past inability to say goodbye. For many years my way of dealing with things was to cut and run and not look back. I was forever fleeing from something or someone or some place, a disastrous situation, for example, or my various addictions or ruined relationships. This state of flight felt like a creative, motivating force, yet was actually completely devoid of reflection, and certainly unimpeded by the corrective influence of regret. I felt that if I ever stopped I would be eaten alive by the chaos that followed me around like a stray dog. It took many years before I found the resolve to turn around and stare down the imagined monster of my past. I found, when I finally looked, many ancient and festering wounds that a timely and heartfelt goodbye could well have healed.

 Over time I have learned that the opportunity to say goodbye is the ultimate privilege. It can serve as a sigh of remembered love, a reparative breath that precedes an adjournment, a pause of gratitude before you inhabit the next you. To say goodbye, as difficult as it can be, must be seen as a gesture of reverence to the passage of life because there are many to whom this opportunity is denied, with devastating effect. There are those who are snatched away who never had the opportunity to comprehend the immense significance of their lives, and there are those left behind who stand yearning before a vacuum, paralysed in an eternal farewell that can never be spoken.

 So, to your question, Else, how do we say goodbye? We summon the courage by understanding that to say goodbye is an act of appreciation for the past that we have moved beyond, and a prelude to the new you that will, in time, require its own goodbye, and as you continue to grow, further goodbyes, each a rehearsal for the final, most precious goodbye of all. The way to say goodbye is to turn and face the past and administer the word as an offering of gratitude and also a healing gesture of mercy, and simply say it. Goodbye.

 I am sorry I have taken so long to answer this question. You sent it to The Red Hand Files almost nine months ago and I have carried it with me all this time, wanting to answer, but never quite knowing how. I think this little question has stayed with me, not just because of the lovely beat of pathos in it, but also because of its extraordinary existential reach. It seemed that it spoke to all of us, yet it felt simply beyond me to answer.

 Aloneness and loneliness are two very different things, of course. I spend much of my time alone; I always have. I have learnt that being alone, as bereft as it perhaps feels to some, is busy with meaning and disclosure. For me, it is an essential place that intensifies the essence of oneself, in all its rampant need. It is the site of demons and sudden angels and raw truths; a quiet, haunted place and a place of unforeseen understandings. A place of unmasking and unveiling. It can be industrious or melancholic or frightening, sometimes all at the same time, yet within it there is a feeling of a latent promise that holds great power. Like Jesus praying alone in the garden, or Mary Magdalene alone at the mouth of Christ’s tomb, aloneness holds moments that tremble on the brink of revelation and great change.

 And then there is loneliness, which is aloneness without choice, an enforced condition that yearns for recognition, to be seen and to be heard. This brave and unguarded admission appears to be the aching heart of your question. As I sat on the plane travelling to Reykjavik for the last show of my ‘In Conversation’ tour, I felt suddenly that there was something I could say to you. Having spent much time travelling on this tour alone, it struck me that your question didn’t have to be answered, but simply acknowledged; that to reach out to you, as you reached out to me, could in itself be the answer and, perhaps, a remedy – to say to you, you are not alone, we are here, and that we, a multitude, are thinking of you.

With a wrath that blackens the entire sky
The beasts all watch through a special telescope

 And in time I leave her there and go

 For I can see a moment in between

How do I get her to understand that just because I might write a poem about some lusty girl I saw on the train I don’t actually want to sleep with another woman?","Dear Circium,

 Tom Waits famously wrote “You are innocent when you dream”, yet dreams are not nearly as innocent as they seem. Neither are songs nor poetry. Songwriting and poetry are perilous callings, full of intrigue and infidelity. They are covert undertakings that creep around our deepest and most hazardous needs. They are not for the squeamish or the eager to please.

 I believe you when you say you don’t want to sleep with the ‘lusty girl on the train’ – the problem is what you want to do is actually worse. You want to write a poem about her. To write a song or a poem about another human being can be one of the most intensely intimate acts a person can perform, it is an act of profound, unblinking contemplation, a near religious meditation on that moment of carnal recognition.

 Listen to Patti Smith’s version of ‘Gloria’, where she has taken Van Morrison’s already wolfish classic and expanded it into a supercharged religious rumination on lust.

  

 I look out the window

 See a sweet young thing

 Humpin’ on the parking meter

 Leanin’ on the parking meter

  

 Patti Smith’s ‘Gloria’ is not concerned so much with the actual sexual encounter, but rather with the brutal carnality and religious ecstasy of language itself. It is one of the most demented displays of predatory sexual desire ever recorded. Yet, it is beyond sex. It is even beyond worship. It is poetry. The “sweet young thing” that is “humpin’ on the parking meter” is your “lusty girl on a train”.

 Gloria, Peggy Sue, Billie Jean, Angie, Delilah, Fernando, Jolene, Ruby, Maggie May, Chuck E., Sharona, Sara, Suzanne, Sweet Caroline and, indeed, Deanna – these names live on, as sacrificial lambs, compulsively sexualised in our collective consciousness.

 My song ‘Deanna’ was seen as a particularly brutal act of betrayal, and thirty years on I still haven’t been fully forgiven. I console myself with the thought that I was unflinching in my duties as a songwriter and in doing so wrote a song that brought joy to the lives of many, even though it broke a heart (or two) in the process.

 From one wordsmith to another, and from someone who has spent a considerable amount of a long and contentious career in the songwriter’s doghouse, that’s the name of the game, Circium. Harsh as it is, we spend our lives walking on the hearts and messy eggshells we have smashed in order to make the omelet that feeds the multitudes.

 I can perfectly understand why you want your girlfriend to read your stuff, as we poets and songwriters often have little else to offer than our words, and of course our perverse little truths. However, your poems are intimations of an eroticized and imaginative adventure of which your partner is excluded. It’s little wonder she might be reluctant to get involved.

 Having said that, over time I have discovered great poetic and personal value in writing about the familiar, that which is in front of you, that which you see every day, that which sleeps beside you, for often that quotidian presence is the most extraordinarily complex and dangerous thing of all. It holds a looking glass up to beautiful and terrible truths that live inside us. As we look into our lover’s eyes and see our reflected selves, our courage as writers is tested and enlarged.

 The girl on the train will always be there, forever travelling through that imaginative space, but maybe the challenge for you as a poet lies within the intricate wonder of the one who sits before you. She is, after all, your mirror.

I love her music. I think she’s an amazing person and she writes brilliant songs.

Next Question

I had a real hard time with your music, my boyfriend was a fan, until The Boatman’s Call. This record really spoke to me. Can you explain?","Dear Ramon and Tanya,

 The truth of the matter is that I didn’t give up on PJ Harvey, PJ Harvey gave up on me. There I am, sitting on the floor of my flat in Notting Hill, sun streaming through the window (maybe), feeling good, with a talented and beautiful young singer for a girlfriend, when the phone rings. I pick up the phone and it’s Polly.

 “Hi,” I say

 “I want to break up with you.” 

 “Why?!” I ask.

 “It’s just over,” she says. 

  

 I was so surprised I almost dropped my syringe.

  

 ***

  

 Deep down I suspected that drugs might have been a problem between us, but there were other things too. I still had a certain amount of work to do on my understanding of the concept of monogamy, and Polly had her own issues, I suspect, but I think at the end of the day it came down to the fact that we were both fiercely creative people, each too self-absorbed to ever be able to inhabit the same space in any truly meaningful way. We were like two lost matching suitcases, on a carousel going nowhere.

 Songwriting completely consumed me at that time. It was not what I did, but what I was. It was the very essence of me. Polly’s commitment to her own work was probably as narcissistic and egomaniacal as my own, although I was so deep into my own shit that I can’t really comment on this with any certainty. I remember our time together with great fondness though, they were happy days, and the phone call hurt; but never one to waste a good crisis, I set about completing The Boatman’s Call.

  

 ***

  

 The Boatman’s Call cured me of Polly Harvey. It also changed the way I made music. The record was an artistic rupture in itself, to which I owe a great debt. It was the compensatory largesse for a broken heart, or at least what I thought at the time was a broken heart – in recent years I have re-evaluated that term. The break up filled me with a lunatic energy that gave me the courage to write songs about commonplace human experiences (like broken hearts) openly, boldly and with meaning – a kind of writing that I had, until that date, steered clear of, feeling a need to instead conceal my personal experiences in character-driven stories. It was a growth spurt that pushed me in a direction and style of songwriting that has remained with me ever since – albeit in different guises. It also pointed a way to a more poignant, raw, stripped back way of performance – the suspended and barely supported vocal. The Bad Seeds, to their eternal credit, stepped back and just let these piano-driven songs be. There are few bands on earth that understand that to not play, can be as important as its opposite.

 Tanya, maybe it is a combination of all of these elements that changed the way you felt about The Bad Seeds’ music. Perhaps there is also a feminine energy within The Boatman’s Call which you respond to.

56,August 2019,https://www.theredhandfiles.com/what-is-rings-of-saturn-about,what-is-rings-of-saturn-about,1,LISA,BERLIN,GERMANY,"What is the song ‘Rings of Saturn’ about? I find myself in these lyrics. In Berlin I couldn’t stop crying when you performed it live. “Up and further up, up, up, up.” Is this song about evolving? I would love to know what you had in mind.","Dear Lisa,

 There is great danger in asking a songwriter to explain their songs – or at least to make the assumption that their interpretation is in some way more valid or true than your own. This is simply not the case. I believe the fan often has a deeper understanding of a given song than its creator. Sometimes, I feel that I am the last to know what one of my own songs actually means. Sometimes, they take many years to reveal themselves. With that in mind, as you’ve asked, I will tell you what I think is going on in ‘Rings of Saturn’. I only hope my answer does not diminish the value of the song for you.

 Warren emailed me a simple circular chord pattern that we had improvised in the studio. He liked its lo-fi, joyful feel. Sitting at the kitchen table, and using the Voice Memo App on my iPhone, I freestyled a lyric over the top and pinged it back to Warren.

 Like several of the songs from Skeleton Tree, because the lyrics are essentially improvised, they tend to be ambiguous, unguarded, and to a certain extent, beyond my control. This, I believe, gives these particular songs their reckless power.

 Listening to it now it seems the song is in three distinct parts. In the first verse, the narrator is involved in a sexual encounter with a woman, who is consumed by her own promiscuity. By using a voyeuristic cascade of erotic images – “upside down and inside out”, “like a funnel web”, “skinny white haunches high and skyward”, “black oily gash”, “crawling backwards”, “wet black fur” – the narrator propels the sexual encounter from the mundane, into the deep space of the imagination – “above the shops, the crowds, the cars and the town” – to the place where true sexual expression exists.

 The chorus that follows suggests that, through this encounter the woman manifests her essential nature – “this is exactly what she was born to be” – and by implication, so too does the man. The euphoric lift of the chords on the chorus gives this notion a joyously old school and consensually abandoned feel.

 The second verse then shifts into something different, and as the encounter becomes more surreal – “the air buckles and rushes in”, “her body moon-blue as a jellyfish” – the lyric turns its concerns away from the act itself, to the inability of the songwriter to do justice to the essentialness of this elemental moment. There are things beyond art that are carnal and godless, and the disempowered writer “spurts his ink across the sheets”, leaving her “completely unexplained”, and abandons himself to the servitude of her imperial feminine potential.

 This time the chorus presents the woman as the divine force, beyond explanation, beyond description. She just cosmically is.

 In the third and final verse, the real world comes rushing back, and the woman rises from her bed. We see she is a mother, “stepping over piles of sleeping children”, as she reinstates herself to the chosen function of her womanhood – the nurturer, the provider, the font of life. As the sleeping children, born of this creative act, dream their innocent dreams, the mother ascends into the melancholy splendour of the cosmos and “dangles herself from the rings of Saturn” – in recognition of both the joy and sorrow of womanhood.

 I love to perform it live because the rising, building chords take us to a place of collective bliss – of tearful, hopeful and mutually transcendent love. I suspect, Lisa, this is what you felt, that made you feel so emotional. I hope so.

 When Warren received the iPhone recording I sent to him, he responded immediately. “A fucking classic.” The whole exchange took fifteen minutes.

I am currently seeing/hearing the name of someone my reason told me to forget, at least once a day (in books, on the streets). It’s like a daily reminder to maybe not listen to my reason.

Next Question

My husband died some years ago but I feel him all around. How can this be?","Far be it from us to believe in signs; far be it from us to believe in spirits; far be it from us to intuit indications that the universe is not as it seems or, worse, that the dead are trying to tell us something – oh no! – because that would make us delusional (Richard Dawkins) or intellectually dishonest (Sam Harris) or in denial of death (Ernest Becker) or unreasonable (Steven Pinker) or cowardly (Bertrand Russell) or stupid (Ricky Gervais) or woo-woo (George from Alabama) – and we can’t have that! Yet here we are, with these lurking suspicions, these hunches, all around us. What do we do with them?

 Often, while grieving, many of us are gripped by a form of madness, and start to believe, against our better judgments, all manner of lunacies and magical thinking; we believe our loved ones visit us in our dreams, we see them across crowded rooms, we think we hear their voices, we believe they inhabit other forms, we feel their ghost-hands in our own, we experience their presence “all around”.

 These uncomfortable intuitions are confessed, in hushed and furtive tones, with a certain embarrassment, because we remember a time when we were rational people, a time when we thought there was some logical system to the universe, when we could believe in the protective power of reason, when the world made sense – and we realise that to admit to these intuitions may appear deluded or, worse, feeble-minded.

 Two days after our son died, Susie and I went to the cliff where he fell. Now, when Arthur was a small child, he always, always, had a thing about ladybird beetles. He loved them. He drew them. He identified with them. He constantly talked about them. As we sat there, a ladybird landed on Susie’s hand. We both saw it, but said nothing, because even though we recognised the sad significance of it, we were not about to belittle the enormity of the tragedy with some sentimental display of magical thinking. But we were new to grief. We were unaware of grief’s particular appetites. When we returned home, as I was opening the door to our house, another ladybird landed on my hand. Since then Susie and I see ladybirds everywhere. When Warren and I were working on the last album a plague of ladybirds came into the studio. I don’t know what to make of this phenomenon, but each time I see a ladybird I receive a kind of jolt of recognition that maybe something is at play within the world that is beyond my comprehension, even though it is, in all probability, just ladybird season.

 This need to believe in something beyond ourselves is a basic human function. Humans are essentially religious creatures by nature; we are possessed by inclinations and intuitions that are at odds with the rational world. For some of us, this is not simply wishful thinking or lack of nerve or being “stupid”, but a survival instinct that can bring great meaning to our lives, whether or not it conforms to the facts.

 So, Aylyn, do I believe in signs? Well, I prefer to say that I have made, for reasons of survival, a commitment to the uncertain nature of the world. This is where my heart lies. I suspect it always has. And, Malina, I am joined in this enterprise by a legion of fellow grievers, many of us deranged by loss, and embarrassed by our sentimental inclinations. We tread gently around each other’s irrationalities because we know they are the fragile foundations of our vacillating sanity. You may hear some people say that feelings are not facts, but this is untrue. Feelings, to some, are facts. Sometimes these intuitions hold more truth than the rational world can ever hope to offer – when we are faced with a world that has long since stopped making sense and, indeed, lost its reason.

 I think we disregard our intuitions at our peril. If you are left feeling the world is more mysterious than you perhaps once thought, and this feeling provides you with some sort of comfort, I would move toward the meaning, in whatever form it presents itself, because meaning is the antidote to despair, and, well, sometimes meaning can feel in scant supply and despair seems all around. My advice to the both of you is quietly, covertly, embrace the mystery that presents itself. It is yours alone.

54,August 2019,https://www.theredhandfiles.com/what-your-thoughts-are-merchandising-of-art,what-your-thoughts-are-merchandising-of-art,1,PIERS,LONDON,UK,"I recently received a pair of ‘Bad Seed’ tube socks as a birthday present. A thoughtful gift from a dear friend, but they have left me somewhat confused. The almost spiritual connection I feel to you and The Bad Seeds’ work seems at odds with what is essentially banal (though very nicely designed) merchandise. I love the socks, I’ve worn the socks, but I feel they might be a representation of everything your work isn’t.

I wonder what your thoughts are on the merchandising of art, and whether or not you’d wear tube socks with the name of an artist you greatly admired on?","Dear Piers,

 As I write, I am wearing an ancient Sonic Youth Goo T-shirt from 1990, back when I was in Thurston Moore’s good books. I also own a very beautiful Flatbush Zombies T-shirt, bought around the release of their first album. A few years ago the Zombies and I attempted a collaboration and I sent them my version of the T. Rex classic, Cosmic Dancer. They said they “could not relate to it” but they radically pitch-shifted my voice, sampled it and used it anyway, as the percussive heartbeat to an extraordinarily wild and fucked-up piece of hip-hop that neither of us released. I have a series of very lovely Current 93/David Tibet T-shirts, and a tote bag and some weird little esoteric Tibet pin things, all based on his visionary artwork. When I first came to London, David gave me an education in Christian mysticism, as we bonded over Spanish wine and our love of the artist Louis Wain. I also possess several ruined Dirty Three T-shirts featuring Mick Turner’s lovely mythic paintings – and a silver plastic Dirty Three sheriff’s badge, which I treasure because it is arguably the crappiest piece of merchandise ever made, but is a powerful emblem of the bad old days. I have an unused Dirty Three Ocean Songs tea towel – oh wow! a goldfinch just landed on my windowsill! – and Warren’s favourite AC/DC T-shirt, which I borrowed from him about twenty-five years ago and have still not returned. I also have an amazing T-shirt which Susie gave to me that says “Beyoncé Wasn’t Built in a Day”, although I suspect this is a bootleg. My favourite and most treasured piece of merchandise, though, is an original Elvis Aloha from Hawaii via Satellite T-shirt, sent to me by someone who claimed to have actually been at the concert in 1973. These items, Piers, are just the tip of a terrifying and deeply nostalgic iceberg – but a T-shirt, a pair of socks, a tea towel, a badge, it’s all essentially banal merchandise.

 However, banal and as exploitative as these things may be, I value some of them hugely, and if there were a fire in my house they could quite possibly be the first things I would grab after the dogs. They have immense sentimental value, they are attached to certain times, people, places and things I love, and are enormously meaningful. I have a feeling that, similarly, many other music lovers have a T-shirt, a pair of socks or a hoodie that they value, and wear with a kind of reverence, not just for the artist, but for their own past – a past that, like their T-shirt, is old, faded, full of holes and beloved memories.

 So, Piers, to answer your question would I wear a pair of merch socks myself? The answer is well, yeah, I do – when I do Jane Fonda’s Workout with my wife, I wear a pair of Radiohead compression socks, RiRi sweatpants, a Leather Nun T-shirt and a Dire Straits headband. I am a star jumping, butt clenching dervish of banality and exploitation. Look at me now!

Next Question

When was the last time you felt a sense of pride (in yourself)?","Dear David and Laura,

 Recently, I watched the movie Mandy with my sons – a terrifying but beautiful film. The song ‘Starless’ by King Crimson was used to great effect during the opening credits. My sons agreed that this was an amazing song, which made me happy because when I was a teenager I was a huge King Crimson fan. King Crimson was able to combine extraordinary moments of purity and fragility with super heavy rock ‘n’ roll, and maybe they imprinted somewhere in my mind the template for some of the more schizophrenic Bad Seeds songs. King Crimson were masters of the sudden violent eruption. Bill Bruford, their drummer was simply off the planet and Robert Fripp was my favourite guitarist at the time, along with, of course, David Gilmour. As a teenager, I was a big English progressive rock fan. Pink Floyd, Jethro Tull, Procol Harum, Yes, Emerson, Lake and Palmer – I loved that stuff. I still do. To this day, Robert Fripp and David Gilmour are giants to me, and remain among my favourite guitarists. Fripp and Gilmour are very different players but there is something about the tone of their instruments that touches me in a very deep place. The same goes for Funkadelic’s Eddie Hazel (check out Maggot Brain!). These guitarists play as if they are singing, I think. Tonally and emotionally, David Gilmour’s guitar is simply a supercharged version of his voice – satiny, stirring and epic. Robert Fripp’s guitar sound is more radical, dangerous and unpredictable, but even at his most confrontational that lyrical and songlike quality is never far away.

 In 2010, Grinderman recorded a song called ‘Heathen Child’ for the Grinderman 2 album (part of a yet to be completed trilogy, you might be happy to know) and we invited Robert Fripp to play on the extended version. This version, called ‘Super Heathen Child’, is Grinderman at their very best. I felt as though Grinderman was laying claim to their roots. Many music critics thought that Grinderman was a return to the sound of The Birthday Party, but I never understood that. From my own perspective within the band, Grinderman was much more influenced by the British progressive rock of my youth than anything else (except Miles Davis’ late electronic period, perhaps). ‘Super Heathen Child’ continues to have an extraordinary hold over me, and contains within it a deep emotional pull because it is attached directly to my adolescence. Listening to it, I have that strange dizzying feeling a dream has when it suddenly becomes a reality; all that deep concentrated listening I did when I was a teenager manifesting itself over forty years later in a Fripp solo that just blows the mind. Recording with Robert Fripp remains one of the seismic events of my life.

 So, to answer your question, Laura, encouraged by my sons’ appreciation for ‘Starless’ by King Crimson in the film Mandy, I did something that I very rarely do. I played one of my songs to my children. I put ‘Super Heathen Child’ by Grinderman (featuring Robert Fripp) on the record player and cranked it all the way up, and well, Laura, it sounded good, and they seemed to really like it; and I was proud.

I hope not! Thank you so much for this project & your music!

Next Question

Do you ever get tired of all the pretentious fat lesbians who enjoy your music? Personally I enjoy a lot of your music, but I find most of your fans insufferable. I’m just wondering if you’re on the same page.","Dear Jessica and George,

 Jesus said on the cross, “Forgive them for they know not what they do.” George, I think Jesus may have been talking directly to you.

 Some weeks ago, I answered a question at one of my “In Conversation” events. I was defending people’s right to say what they wanted. I was defending people’s right to offend. In short, I was defending the idea of free speech. It seems that these days free speech has fallen out of favour. The concept has been polarised by some and now a free speech advocate is often seen – I feel somewhat bizarrely – to be aligned to the far-right. However, I do believe that, even though we should have the right to say what we like, there are consequences to what we say and just because we can speak freely, it does not – and should not – inoculate us against these consequences.

 This is why it is important to think something through before sending those thoughts out into the world. When I set about answering a question on The Red Hand Files, I find it helpful to write my thoughts down before I formulate them into an answer. This scrutiny has its purpose, because it helps me to see where my thinking could be dishonest, unhelpful and damaging.

 So, in the interests of free speech, George, I have given you a platform. However, and I am speculating here, I think that probably ninety-nine percent of the people who read your question will think that you are being, well, a bit of an asshole. I could be wrong. It could be more. Now, you may say “So what? No one knows who I am. How can this possibly hurt me?” You may say that. But you would be wrong. I do not believe that your anonymity protects you, any more than I believe the anonymity of the hate trolls on social media protects them. I feel that there are psychic pathways that exist between us all, and that the negativity we create eventually finds its way back to us.

 The opportunity to act in a better way is one that is continuously afforded to us – to try to make the next thing we do the best thing, rather than the worst thing, the destructive thing. In this instance, George, it’s not too late for you. If you close your eyes and apologise to my fans, just maybe that negative attention will begin to dissipate. I think my fans are smart enough and sufficiently forgiving to understand that your words extend only to the margins of your own individual evolution.

 When Jesus said, “Forgive them for they know not what they do.” He meant that there is room for everyone to become better, every single one of us, because all of us really, “know not what we do.” We understand ourselves only to the limits of our own personal development as human beings. Yet, we can go further than that. There is always room to evolve, to become better at being human, and to advance the common cause of humanity and civility – this applies not just to you, George, but to me too and, indeed, to all of us.

Geppetto (Pinocchio’s father) is swallowed by a giant whale while searching for Pinocchio. When Pinocchio hears of this news, he travels deep into the ocean to find the whale that swallowed up Geppetto. Pinocchio makes his way inside the whale and reunites with his father. They build a huge fire causing the whale to sneeze. They are then blasted ashore and left to start their lives over together.

If this is a truism that, in essence, the son saved his father from the abyss. Then now what of people like us? What happens if the son dies? Do we lose the ability to be saved and evolve? [ ]","Dear K,

 I read about the death of your son in the paper. I am so very sorry. Thank you for your letter – it was honest, searching and beautifully articulated. I think that it is better not to publish it in full though, so as not to rekindle any attention that could cause unnecessary suffering for you and your family. I hope you don’t mind.

 You talked about the story of Pinocchio, a story I love very much. I included it as one of my favourite books in a recent Red Hand File. Geppetto, the maker and father of the puppet-boy Pinocchio, trapped in the darkened belly of the beast, is a very powerful metaphor for the father who has been separated from his child – the grieving father. The epic story of the incorrigible Pinocchio’s attempt at reuniting with his father and becoming a real boy is one of the most moving in all literature.

 We grieving fathers, all of us, begin our time in the vast and darkened belly of the beast. We also have become the child, as you said in your letter – and perhaps some dark force had always destined that to be. For a while we become the one that died, as we are plunged into a darkness from which there seems no escape. But you also mentioned the inability of the child to save the father from ‘the abyss’ if the child has died. Eventually, I found this not to be true. I found the spirit of my son was ultimately able to release me from this terrible place.

 The spirits of our children can become the guides that eventually lead us out of the dark. After a while, I found the spirit of my son braved the sea and found and entered the whale, and lighting the fire, convulsed the whale and released me from its unlit interior, ‘blasting me ashore’.

 Most of the time, these days, I feel on solid ground and in the air and the light. But the process has been slow. You are in your very early days. It is four years to the day for me, yet still my son comes to the rescue – parenting me, fathering me, as the darkness reasserts itself. Yet I see a day when my son can let go of my hand and return to his spirit-form – the child – and be free. I can become his father again. That day is coming, but is not here yet, for you or for me. We are still, as you said, on some level, ‘living in another world’ with the departed.

 I read Pinocchio again this week, after you wrote to me – I hadn’t read it since the death of my son – and I found it very helpful. What a deep little book it is. These stories talk to us, down the ages, and give us powerful images that can articulate our deepest feelings and help make some sense of things. Thank you for reminding me of it and, again, I am so sorry to hear about your little boy.

hopeing that sometimes ‘someone’ leesen you’r

despered ‘litle’ iner-voice, to get answer

or gidence, ephifany, in this cruel world,

which most of us taket for granted?","Dear Gianelli,

 I love this despairing and soulful question so much. I have put it in verse form and changed the spacing so that it behaves as a poem, rather than a question, as it rises hauntingly from the dark. I hope you don’t mind. I will do my best to answer it.

 Firstly, do I pray with my family and friends? The answer is sadly no. My family, and especially my friends, are mostly not the praying types, and I’m not sure they would know who to pray to if they were – apart that is from darling Susie, my wife. Susie prays a lot, I think, but alone, I would say, terribly alone. I do pray myself – and I also meditate; prayer and meditation are different practices but they serve a similar function.

 Do I hope someone listens to my prayers – to my inner voice? Well, I don’t know where my prayers go. I don’t know if anyone is listening. However, I still kneel down alone and pray. My prayers mostly revolve around the wellbeing of the ones I love, because I feel, possibly erroneously, that the world aligns itself in such a way that it draws those I send my prayers to closer to me. I feel, without any evidence to suggest that this is true, that the people I pray for benefit from my prayers, as if the energy of my prayers travels along streams of collective goodness that connect us all in some way, in a sort of humanistic cooperation of light and compassion.

 Do I get guidance from prayer and meditation? The answer is certainly, yes. After applying my full attention to whatever it is I am praying about – and to whoever it is I am praying to – I feel that I simply know how to proceed in a rightful way; one that causes the least harm to myself and to others. I feel less a victim of the endless self-defeating thoughts that can go on in my mind, and instead I feel a quietness and clarity of thought.

 Is this world cruel? I don’t think so. I think this world is indifferent and indifference is not cruelty. What connects me to you, Gianelli, and you to every other sentient being in the universe, is that the universe, simply does not care about us; it does not act with malice or desire to harm us – it is simply unaffected by our condition. If one acknowledges this state of affairs, then it sets up a situation that allows us to make a simple choice – either we respond to the indifference of the universe with self-pity and narcissism – as if the world has in some way personally betrayed us – and live our lives in a cynical, pessimistic and self-serving manner; or we stand tall, set our eyes clearly upon this unfeeling universe and love it all the same – even though, or especially because, it doesn’t love us. This act of cosmic defiance, of subversive optimism, of unconditional and insubordinate love, is the greatest act of human beauty we can perform. To stand before this great, blank, heartless cosmic event and say: ‘We believe in you’. ‘We love you’. ‘We care for you’. This is the definition of grace, Gianelli, and this is the epiphany you speak of. We create our own divinity, our own Godliness, through our ferocious need. We yearn the heavens awake, and if we are quiet, in prayer or in meditation, sometimes we can feel the heavens stirring, breathing our fragile and reckless love back through us. 

 Thank you for your question.

 I read somewhere that between the ages of seventeen and twenty-four our brains are super-receptive, and that it is the period when we form acutely close attachments to things – songs, books, films, paintings etc. – that will be the guiding lights that lead us through the rest of our lives. So, Alejandrá, Eva and Marat, you are all in those bright and shining years where you should absorb as much art as possible. Drink it up, while the thrill is there, whenever and wherever you can, because as the years go on, that flush of wonder may subside, as we direct our attention to our own work.

 As with the other lists I have posted here on The Red Hand Files, this is in no way definitive and by no means reflects the ‘best’ books I have read, nor are these necessarily the greatest books by the particular author I have chosen, but here are a dozen books of fiction that I love. Most of them I read when I was a quite young, and each of them introduced me to worlds that were strange and fascinating and new. I hope you like them.

48,June 2019,https://www.theredhandfiles.com/views-on-morrissey,views-on-morrissey,1,MARK,REDHILL,UK,"I was lucky enough to be at your recent London show and you played Cosmic Dancer by T Rex. It reminded me how Morrissey also covered and released this. In turn it reminded me of my current struggle reconciling his recent unsavoury far right support to how I used to put him on a pedestal.
Generally, is it possible to separate the latter-day artist from his earlier art? More specifically, what are your views on Morrissey, both early days and his newer more ugly persona?","Dear Mark,

 I understand it is very difficult when an artist you admire reveals something about themselves which you feel casts an unhappy shadow across their work – and this is by no means exclusive to Morrissey. It happens all the time and I have talked a little about this in a previous issue of The Red Hand Files.

 I think perhaps it would be helpful to you if you saw the proprietorship of a song in a different way. Personally, when I write a song and release it to the public, I feel it stops being my song. It has been offered up to my audience and they, if they care to, take possession of that song and become its custodian. The integrity of the song now rests not with the artist, but with the listener.

 When I listen to a beloved song – Neil Young’s ‘On the Beach’, for instance – I feel, at my very core, that that song is speaking to me and to me alone, that I have taken possession of that song exclusively. I feel, beyond all rationality, that the song has been written with me in mind and, as it weaves itself into the fabric of my life, I become its steward, understanding it better than anybody else ever could. I think we all can relate to this feeling of owning a song. This is the singular beauty of music.

 Perhaps it doesn’t matter what Neil Young’s personal conduct may be like therefore, or Morrissey’s, as they have handed over ownership of the songs to their audience. Their views and behaviour are separate issues – Morrissey’s political opinion becomes irrelevant. Whatever inanities he may postulate, we cannot overlook the fact that he has written a vast and extraordinary catalogue, which has enhanced the lives of his many fans beyond recognition. This is no small thing. He has created original and distinctive works of unparalleled beauty, that will long outlast his offending political alliances.

 At my recent ‘In Conversation’ event in Nottingham a gentleman put forward an excellent challenge to my views on free speech – he pointed out the perceived racism of Morrissey’s political stance and told how personally wounded he felt by Morrissey’s views on immigration. As I sat in my dressing room after the show, I wished I had done a better job of answering his question – I felt I had made a poorly constructed, over-earnest and possibly insensitive defence of Morrissey’s right to his opinions, no matter what they are.

 I very much appreciate people challenging my views. The ‘In Conversation’ events are fluid in form and very much a work in progress, and they are intended at times to prompt debate. Sometimes certain uncomfortable issues are raised, but a different point of view is always welcome. Often it can serve as a kind of corrective – even an education – and can be extremely helpful to me next time that same subject is broached.

 Open debate and conversation are the very structure of civilisation, and in Nottingham it was a privilege to be challenged by this very thoughtful young man. However, even though I was unsatisfied by my own response, I still believe that despite how upsetting Morrissey’s views may be to the marginalised and dispossessed members of society, or anyone else for that matter, he still should have the freedom to express his views, just as others should have the freedom to challenge them – even if just to know in what guise their enemy may appear. The charge that defending a person’s right to their opinions somehow aligns one with their views makes no sense at all and strikes at the heart of the problem itself – that of conflating the concept of free speech with bigotry. This is very dangerous territory indeed.

 As a songwriter and someone who believes songs possess extraordinary healing power, I am saddened by the thought that songs by arguably the greatest lyricist of his generation – songs like ‘This Charming Man’, ‘Reel Around the Fountain’ and ‘Last Night I Dreamed Somebody Loved Me’ – are consigned to the moral dustbin by those who feel they have been tainted by his current political posturing. I respect and understand why people respond in this way, but can’t help but feel it is of significant personal loss to them.

 Perhaps it is better to simply let Morrissey have his views, challenge them when and wherever possible, but allow his music to live on, bearing in mind we are all conflicted individuals – messy, flawed and prone to lunacies. We should thank God that there are some among us that create works of beauty beyond anything most of us can barely imagine, even as some of those same people fall prey to regressive and dangerous belief systems.

If this statement resonates with you, what are your thoughts?

Next Question

The greatest songs, I think, you wrote under influence of drugs. How is it these days?","Dear Michael and Peti,

 Clearly you people have a difference of opinion. Maybe many an hour is spent amongst Bad Seeds fans squaring the merits of a song like The Mercy Seat, that was written during a period of serious and prolonged heroin and amphetamine use, against Jubilee Street, which was written by two drug-free vegetarians, or comparing a ballad like Love Letter (very stoned) with its tragic counterpart, I Need You (very straight). What makes me happy is that there is actually a conversation to be had. In rock ‘n’ roll there almost never is. Sometimes, but mostly never.

 But all speculation aside, the value of a song does not rest with the song itself, but rather the feeling it can provoke in the listener. What moves me may not move you. And so it goes. I see the effect the songs have on my audience when we perform them live so know that these value judgements have little intrinsic meaning – Girl in Amber may have a young fan in floods of tears and another fan stifling yawns and looking at their watch, and a song like Tupelo can tap into a reservoir of nostalgia for an older fan, but to a millennial, say, be just some crazy shit about a guy called Elvis (and who is Elvis anyway?) One man at a recent In Conversations event told me he got married to Rock of Gibraltar (true story), yet a Gibraltarian wrote to me saying that the release of this ‘atrocious song’ was a ‘dark day for Gibraltar’ and that he had suggested lowering the national flag to half-mast. I have people write to me to say Skeleton Tree is the worst record the Bad Seeds ever made, and I have also read letters from people who value that record beyond all others.

 In the end, all I can do as a songwriter is to follow my own heart. I have written most days of my adult life, some of them stoned and some of them straight, and the most I have been able to do was to give the process itself my best shot. The actual value of the songs is weighed entirely in the hearts of those who choose to receive them.

Next Question

How do you forgive yourself for the horrible things you did to someone else in the throes of addiction?","Dear Ray and Matt,

 As chance would have it I was clearing some papers off my desk yesterday and found these words, which I think I wrote a couple of years ago but sort of forgot about. The lyric is called ‘Kiss of the Spider Woman’ and is actually pretty good. As a rock ‘n’ roll lyric it is more fit for purpose than ‘Incinerator Man’ (from #43) – which, to be honest, reads more like a conventional poem – so it’s probably easier to arrange these words to music. Ray, you can have it, if you like. If you record and release it, and it becomes a hit and you go on to become a world-famous pop star, well, I’ll be happy. I’ll also be very surprised as the song is about heroin addiction.

 The lyric recalls a time, back in the eighties, when I was stranded in what had to be the worst ‘hotel’ in Tijuana (possibly in the world), withdrawing from a particularly nasty heroin habit. There was a girl involved, of course, and she was Mexican and beautiful and had a tattoo of a spider’s web on her elbow. We’d run out of money and I was strung-out and everything was suitably sordid. We were like a couple of ruined characters from some dreadful Bukowski novel, and if you think it sounds sort of romantic – it wasn’t. I mostly remember lying in my underwear on the ‘bed’ in a pool of sweat, watching insects drop from the ceiling and crawl around on my chest and not having the strength of purpose to do anything about it. I don’t usually dredge up old memories and put them in songs – it’s bad form, in my opinion, it feels like a sort of betrayal of the now – so this is why the song probably never saw the light of day. Having said that, it is a solid rock ‘n’ roll lyric and maybe you can do something with it. I don’t want it.

  

 KISS OF THE SPIDER WOMAN

 I awake to a voice calling from the other side of the wall

 I am alone and tangled in a web of backward thought

  

 The Mexican girl with the luminous skin

 Sponged my face that had fallen on the dosshouse floor

  

 The Mexican girl with the web on her elbow

 Had eyes like windows and legs like a door

  

 I lay there three days dying, three days or maybe more

 We couldn’t close the windows and we sure couldn’t open the door

  

 I love women, but I always loved drugs more

 Even when I was in ‘em, I was halfway out the door to score

  

 I kissed the Spider Woman and she spun me deep inside her silk

 Hung me from the door frame, rubbed me in argan oil and milk

  

 How many blue skies were lost there, how many missed opportunities?

 How many knocked doors unanswered, how many phones left to ring?

  

 How many days lived in the centre of the web, alone and scared?

 How often did I call along the threads, only to find nobody there?

  

 I am alone and tangled in a web of backward thought

 I am the voice calling from the other side of the wall

 So, not a bad lyric, with an elegant shift from the description of memory as a ‘web of tangled thought’, to the ‘web on her elbow’, to the idea of the Spider Woman being the addiction itself, and being ‘spun deep inside her silk’ – lovely metaphor for being stoned, if I may say so myself – followed by the melancholy idea, which every long-term addict will recognise, of ‘calling along the threads to find nobody there’. It then returns full circle to the sticky lacework of recollection. The song is, in itself, a web. This is good stuff, and if you placed the lyrics over a linear two-chord groove, like ‘Born in the USA’, or ‘Jane Says’ by Jane’s Addiction, or ‘Achy Breaky Heart’ or something like that, well, you never know, you may have a monster hit on your hands! Then again you mightn’t. In this game, you never do know. 

 If you are going to use these words, I might just draw your attention to the lovely couplet that divides the lyric into its two parts –

 I love women, but I always loved drugs more

 Even when I was in ‘em, I was halfway out the door to score

 This is in no way a glorification of drug taking, rather these words are heavy with a very real regret for the utter havoc my heroin addiction caused in my relationships with women. Every addict, male or female, will identify with these two lines. However, despite the thread of despair that runs through them, there is much fun to be had in the words themselves and I am especially proud of rhyming ‘women’ with ‘in ‘em’ and the momentum of the internal trip-rhyme ‘door’ with ‘score’, as if the narrator of the song is already making a run for it.

 And, Matt, just to say, all addicts at times do horrible things, because addicts are people and people at times do horrible things. The real difficulty that arises around self-forgiveness is when you come to realise that you still do horrible things even when you are clean. My advice to you is this – be kind – to yourself and to others. It is the simplest of remedies but remarkably effective. A small, bright act of kindness towards another human being is not only a gesture of existential hope, it also reconciles us with the world, and ultimately becomes the path to self-forgiveness.

45,June 2019,https://www.theredhandfiles.com/into-my-arms-love,into-my-arms-love,1,ELS,MECHELEN,BELGIUM,"Dear Nick,

I was at your In Conversation event in Antwerp. There was a man with a light and a microphone, but suddenly he was gone. I just wanted to tell you something.

I didn’t want to tell you and all the other people the full story that evening, just a bit, but I want to tell it to you now.

My partner died in 2014: traffic. At that moment I was actually pregnant by him, but nobody knew. It was still a little early and I was pregnant after fertility-treatment. He died and five days after his death, I lost his child. Our child. He was a huge fan of your music and I think I became a fan of your music because of him.

‘Into My Arms’ became our song. The song was playing and he asked me to dance and so it became our song. Nothing special, but for us it was a special song. I wanted to play it at his funeral. People asked me afterwards if I thought it was a love song or a song of loss. A song of love, I thought. It was a silly question – but the man I love was there in a coffin and I just wanted to hear that song on the day he was buried, because it was our song, the song of our love for each other and I loved that man and I still love him. Nothing more, nothing less, that was the reason I wanted it played at his funeral.

We had already bought tickets for a Bad Seeds concert together. He was dead, so because of that my best friend went with me. You played ‘Into My Arms’ and I started to cry, not because of the sadness, but because of the beauty of it. I was standing there and for the first time since he passed away, I felt my partner standing by my side. Maybe it sounds stupid, but I really felt him standing by my side. My best friend cuddled me and gave me a kiss on my forehead. She cuddled me in a strong way. I was really crying, smiling too and I felt love everywhere, for and from my partner and for and from my best friend too. I went into a kind of trance of love, it was an amazing experience, that’s for sure, and it was when you were playing that song.

I’m crying now, because I feel that same feeling. I still think it was wonderful. It was 2015, those days. My best friend died in 2016: cancer. ‘Into My Arms’ is not just the song for me and my partner anymore, it is the song for and from my best friend and all the people I love, but those two people are standing for true love for me too, so it became a song of true love, true love I actually feel when you play that song. Since they died, I like to be at any of your concerts, because of the amazing beauty I feel when you play ‘Into My Arms’. I feel Guido and Amber beside me. And all I wanted to ask was if you would play that song, so I could feel them again beside me that evening.

The man with the light and the microphone was suddenly gone, but you played ‘Into My Arms’ anyway. I was very grateful that you played it. Now I just want to say “thanks”, for that song, for all of your songs, for such a wonderful evening, because it was with love.","Dear Els,

 Thank you for this beautiful letter. It means a great deal to me.

To most of the people who know me in this shitty country town, I’m a butch dyke. My amazing girlfriend got me into your music, and I honestly can’t adequately thank her for it, and can’t adequately thank you. Especially when I saw some of the music videos, the androgyny and sort of cross-genderedness of your performance style (my girlfriend agrees you often bring an amazing drag-queen energy) make me feel so seen and understood, in a way I never get to in my real life. I never thought I’d see the physical embodiment of what my mind desperately wants my body to be like, though it’ll never be. It was an unformed yearning before. I want to be like you when I grow up. I guess my question is, what would you say to as not-man, not-woman, pseudo-dyke fan and their unformed yearning to feel right in their body and now has an admittedly unattainable model for exactly what they want to be?","Dear Mary “Mickey”,

 I enjoyed your letter very much and I think I understand your notion of “unformed yearning” – a kind of longing that has yet to find its provenance. I have felt something similar for most of my life, although obviously in a very different way, and it has taken me a lifetime to work out who I am, or at least what my own personal value is in the world. It also seems that for most of my life I felt a strange gravitational pull toward an undisclosed traumatic event, that could only be described as a dreadful yearning, and I found it eventually in my son’s death – something that both destroyed me and ultimately defined me. It feels that the unformed yearning that followed me through my days, manifested in the death of my son. Does that make any sense to you? My son’s death brought me to the essence of my formed self. I mention this, because it could be that the unformed yearning that you speak of may turn out to be something that eventually obliterates you, but also brings you back to life, transforming you into something beyond yourself.

 As for the “androgyny and cross-genderedness” that you spoke of in your letter, well, this can be fairly simply explained. Although I am a man – and have spent a fair amount of energy writing about that – I have actually never felt any real allegiance to my masculinity; there was nothing particularly invested in it, and even though I was more or less heterosexual, I have always felt pliant in my navigations between maleness and femaleness, even – and perhaps especially – growing up within the overtly masculine Australian culture. It just wasn’t of any special focus to me – my interests were elsewhere – art, music, image, clothes, etc. – of which many of the students at the school I attended, back in the 70s, were deeply suspicious. My small group of friends and I were known at the school as the “art poofs” – we kind of liked it actually, and happily appropriated a certain queer and rarefied air, as it ring-fenced us off from the rest of the school, and in retrospect it toughened us up for the world to come.

 I am happy that your girlfriend acknowledged my “drag-queen energy” – which means to me, defiant, courageous and savvy; to quote Camille Paglia, “The drag queens of old knew how to handle themselves on the street.” As for me being a role model, well, you could probably do better, but I am honoured to serve as a placeholder until someone more suitable comes along.

 As I said, I very much enjoyed your letter, and maybe I recognise some of what you are talking about. Obviously, I have no real authority to answer you, except to say, I hope you find some form of escape from your “shitty little town”, within yourself or outside of the town itself, and the unformed yearning of which you so beautifully speak, in time, manifests to your needs. Whatever, I am with you.

43,June 2019,https://www.theredhandfiles.com/do-u-have-any-spare-lyrics,do-u-have-any-spare-lyrics,1,DAVID,BALTIMORE,USA,I’m a songwriter. I’m seriously blocked. Do u have any spare lyrics I can have?,"Dear David,

 Sure, here are some lyrics for you. They are a little on the dark side and pretty obscure, and perhaps a bit too heavy on the old Frederick Seidel (I had just been reading his brilliant collection of poems, Peaches Goes It Alone), and maybe there is an unearned and spurious use of Holocaust imagery (I apologise for that), and there is not a hell of lot of structure to it, plus the last verse may need a bit of work – but all that aside, there is some nice symbolism in there and if you chuck on a simple chorus, like “Wo! I’m the Incinerator Man!” and throw it on a lean circular chord formation, with lots of space and air, so that you can really creep the vocal and tell the story, then brother, you may be able to make something worthwhile out of it. I couldn’t.

  

 INCINERATOR MAN

 The moon holds itself in the dark with its glow

 The monster moves through the garden

 And waits beneath the window

 I take the monster for a walk and plough on into town

 My monster has a chimney sticking out of its back

 I try to find a single story I can bring home

 That won’t give you a flat-out heart attack

  

 To be honest I’m not allowed back in the house

 It’s Bethlehem there with its cribs and moping beasts

 I’m either underneath the school desk braced

 Or commuting between Auschwitz and outer space

 I’m thinking of drinking something truly horrible

 I’m a slow moving monster with a giant chimney

 Sticking out of my back. Look out!

 I’m coming now just like I came before!

 I’m all over the place. I’m the same but more.

 There never ever was any turning back

 I’m coming now! I’m a full on heart attack.

  

  

 This, of course, will not help with your “block”. My advice to you is to change your basic relationship to songwriting. You are not the ‘Great Creator’ of your songs, you are simply their servant, and the songs will come to you when you have adequately prepared yourself to receive them. They are not inside you, unable to get out; rather, they are outside of you, unable to get in. Songs, in my experience, are attracted to an open, playful and motivated mind. Throw my song away – it isn’t that good anyway – sit down, prepare yourself and write your own damn song. You are a songwriter. You have the entire world to save and very little time to do it. The song will find its way to you. If you don’t write it, someone else will. Is that what you want? If not, get to it.

42,May 2019,https://www.theredhandfiles.com/desire-for-creation,desire-for-creation,2,PHILIP; KIARA,KIEV; LONDON,UKRAINE; UK,"As one ages, does the reduction of sexual desire affect their general desire for creation, the ability to create or the whole cognitive and sensual involvement of being? { } How is the correlation between the sexual and the creative going in old age? { }

Next Question

Not sure if there is a whole lot of sex in your religion or a whole lot of religion in your sex. Which is it?","Philip, please forgive me for the radical edit I made to your question. It went to a place I was not entirely sure I understood – the gist of which was, I think, that you are a young man who abstains from sex as it allows you to be more “enacted in your existence”, and provides your youthful mind with a heightened sensibility towards your own writing. If I have got that wrong, please excuse me, as I am old, doddery and enfeebled, and certain concepts are simply beyond me.

 If I do have the basic premise of your question correct, then I am happy to impart that sexual desire for the aged, as far as I can tell, is not subject to any particularly dramatic downturn, and the reptilian male brain remains as deranged and priapic as ever. Actually, I have a terrible feeling that as we blunder into our bleak and bladdery winter years, it may just get a whole lot worse. Of course, it may just be that I am living a kind of last hurrah, and in a year or two a band of tearful mermaids will wave goodbye as I sail my little empty boat into the setting sun, with an oar that won’t row, row, row. I don’t know, but I’ll keep you informed.

 With regards to sexual desire and songwriting, creativity and desire have always been inextricably linked for me. Many songs I write are simply erotic re-enactments, written with the sole intention of creating a remembered image of the one I love and, indeed, desire. Beyond that though, there is a certain sexualness to the very act of writing – the process itself is erotic. With songwriting we enter the imagination, that wildest of erogenous zones, where intense, obsessive yearning can be like a roaring in the heart and the loins both. The imagination becomes both the ‘safe space’ and the ‘un-safe space’, a strange blend of almost religious rigour and total abandonment, where everything rises to the starry heavens, even as it goes to hell.

 So to answer your question, Philip, the good news is that this imaginative space still feels alive with potential – old age has not diminished it – indeed, it still rages and burns.

 And, Kiara, to get to your question, I think this is why religion and the erotic are often indistinguishable from each other in my writing – they both inhabit the same yearning space, are both transcendent acts of wishfulness, and both require the imagination to make them function in any meaningful way. You are right to suggest that there may not be any difference between them at all.

At least a couple of people said that God would sound like you. Not me. There is a twistedness to my idea of God that makes me think of Tom Waits. In your mind, does God have a voice and if so, is it a familiar one? Or does God make him/her/itself heard in other ways?","Dear Rute,

 I hope the voice of God would be something other than booming, authoritarian and male. Wouldn’t that be a pleasant surprise? How nice it would be if God’s voice didn’t sound like Nick Cave or Tom Waits – or Morgan Freeman for that matter. What a relief that would be.

 In the recording studio, when you multi-layer vocals, sometimes the more voices you lay down and the more varied they are, the more pure the tone of the chorus becomes, as all individuality is erased and a pristine collected sound flows forth. As you add more voices, a strange inverse reaction happens, and the smaller, more distilled and weirdly intimate the cascade of voices seems to become. Perhaps that is what God sounds like. Perhaps, God would have the combined voice of all the untold billions of collected souls, an assembly of the departed speaking as one – without rancour, domination or division; a great, many-layered calling forth that rings from the heavens in the small, determined voice of a child, maybe; sexless, pure and uncomplicated – that says ‘Look for me. I am here’.

 Yes, I can certainly help you with this problem but it will involve a bit of witchcraft I’m afraid, and you must follow my instructions, closely.

 1) Find a quiet place where you will not be disturbed and sit down and close your eyes.

 2) Bring to mind your “terrible relationship” in all its fucked-upness and, despite how painful this may be, spend a couple of minutes allowing this memory to permeate your mind.

 3) Imagine a shimmering golden cord that attaches you to the memory of this relationship. Really imagine it.

 4) In your mind, speak down the cord to the other person in the relationship, and despite what a douche-bag this person may have been, wish them well. Say –

 May you be happy on your journey wherever it may lead.

 5) Now, imagine a giant pair of scissors cutting the golden cord in half and that “terrible relationship” floating off into space, never to bother you again.

 6) You are now released spiritually from this relationship. Breathe in this freedom and remember these words, from me to you –

 I am returning my songs to you, unharmed. May they remain with you forever.

 7) Now, go to your record player or laptop or whatever and play a Nick Cave and The Bad Seeds song and say –

 I reclaim this song. This song is mine.

 You have now reasserted ownership of these songs. They belong with you. May they travel lightly with you through the years, for they are forever yours.

How long will I be alone?","It was about eight months after our son had died. Susie and I had barely left the house. Susie decided it would be a good idea if we went somewhere for a few days to just get away from it all. Often times you think a change in location might put things right, but, of course, in the end, you take yourself with you and the thing you are running from ultimately finds you. So it was with us. We flew to Marrakesh and checked into a hotel next to the central square.

 That evening, Susie and I walked through the main market place of Marrakesh. It is difficult to exaggerate the suffering of the animals that we saw there – ancient donkeys and workhorses being flogged, monkeys on chains, dozens of chickens stuffed into small cages, emaciated street dogs, skinned carcasses hanging on hooks. Death and suffering and cruelty were everywhere and I felt overwhelmed by a dark energy. How much of this energy existed within Marrakesh itself or how much I was carrying with me was difficult to say, but everywhere I looked I saw existential anguish. I was, in part, seeing this remarkable city through my own cultural prejudices, of course, and it was not lost on me that industrial farming in the West, in terms of net suffering, was on a vastly greater scale than what I was witnessing here on the streets of Marrakesh. However, it was the seeing, the close proximity to the cruelty, that made all the difference.

 Susie had met a man on the plane, an English guy, who had set up a rescue centre for ancient workhorses in Marrakesh and Susie wanted to visit it, so the next day we caught a cab and drove there.

 On the way to the rescue centre, we entered a busy roundabout and saw, in the middle of the road, a cat that had been run over. Its back was broken and it was arched horribly, spraying blood and literally screaming in pain. It was a deeply upsetting sight and one that instantly attached itself to the most vulnerable and traumatic images that lived in my mind. At that moment, something ruptured. I had had enough. Life was too much. It was literally impossible to bear. My son was gone. I would never see him again. In the back of the cab, in Marrakesh, I broke down.

 The next morning, we decided to return to the UK. But, sitting on the plane, something had changed in me. I felt different. I felt that if I were to continue to live in this world I had to do what I could to reduce the existential suffering around me, or at the very least, not to add to it. It felt like a way forward. I felt that our collective unhappiness was brimming at its maximum capacity. There was no room for any more. I felt a sense of duty to do whatever I could, in my own way, to minimise sentient suffering. That call to action extended in many directions, and has stayed with me since, but one of the consequences of it was that I gave up eating meat. I have not eaten it since.

 As we go through our lives we take on the expanding burden of our own distress – as we are abandoned, broken apart, betrayed, isolated, lost and hurt. This is essentially part of what it is to live. This despair will overwhelm us and turn inward into bitterness, resentment and hatred – worse, we will take it out upon the ones closest to us if we do not actively live our lives in the service of others and use what power we have to reduce each other’s suffering. This, in my opinion, is essentially the key to living. This is the remedy to our own suffering; our own feelings of separateness and of disconnectedness. And it is the essential antidote for loneliness.

 We must live our lives in such a way as to make better, even in the smallest way, the situation that we are currently experiencing. This is what it means to ‘take on the suffering of the world’ – that we each act in accordance with the limits of our own personal capacity for good. By doing this, the lives around us will become incrementally better and therefore, so will our own lives, and the life of the world itself.

 In the Philip Larkin poem ‘The Mower’, Larkin runs over a hedgehog while he is mowing the lawn. As he removes the body of the hedgehog from the blades of the mower, he muses on the nature of death and ends the poem with these words.

 We should be careful
Of each other, we should be kind
While there is still time

 The urgency of these words came to me on that flight back from Marrakesh. The vision of the dying cat wrenched me from my own self-absorption and bitterness and isolation and loneliness and showed me that the world, in all its terrible wounded beauty, was in need of our urgent attention.

I was around 8 years old. I would later find much solace during a difficult time in The Boatman’s Call. Now I have 3 young boys and I find it to be the one thing that fills me with both fear and hope. I have an aching about the future world they are coming into. It confuses me – the darkness seems overwhelming.

Next Question

I always liked the line in ‘Nature Boy’, about how beauty is gonna save the world. Is there anything that you think of as essentially beautiful, and that is sustained and forceful enough to save us.","Dear Nick and David,

 I very much understand your distress. It is often difficult to look at the world through anything other than an apocalyptic prism and in doing so, simply despair. You wake up in the morning, look out at the day – blue sky, fluffy clouds – then go online and ten minutes later you have lost the will to live. Sadly, the existential terror we absorb through the constant onslaught of bad news can become the gift we pass onto our children – a terminal anxiety that rings down through the generations and infects everything we do.

 In the first verse of the Bad Seeds song ‘Nature Boy’, I recall an incident that happened when I was fourteen years old, at my grandmother’s house in Melbourne. I saw a news report on TV that showed footage of the attempted assassination of American presidential candidate, George Wallace. I remember it occurring to me that this was real and not made-up, like in the movies, and being extremely disturbed by the images. I had simply never seen anything like it. This particular piece of footage has remained lodged in my memory ever since; Wallace’s speech, the walk through the crowd, the armed assassin, the gun going off, Wallace bleeding on the ground. My father, who was watching TV with me, saw my distress and his response was two-fold. He told me that, yes, these terrible things happen but he also set about showing me stuff he thought was beautiful – reading me things mostly, and encouraging me to follow an artistic direction in my life. It was a simple but effective action, a redressing of the balance of the bad and the good, and life changing in its way.

 So, I have always seen it as a kind of parental duty to show my own children beautiful stuff, and in doing so reveal to them an alternate world. By beautiful, I mean interesting, inspiring, ambiguous, challenging and sometimes dangerous things that exist within the world of art. I feel that the online world provides us ready access to a vast and ever-deepening barrage of bad shit, where the cruel reality of the world is well covered. This continual onslaught of negativity can erode our souls and the souls of our children. My job is to show my children that there is a whole universe that exists beyond the grim issues of the day. This is not to divert them from certain truths, but rather to remind them that the parallel world of art and the imagination can literally save their lives, as it certainly saved mine.

 The good news is that kids react well to this sort of attention. It is nice to imagine that as they go about their business, dealing with the world, they may have a copy of Lolita, similar to that given to me by my father, shoved in their jacket pocket. And as they respond to the world we have built for them, inventing new forms of madness beyond our comprehension (as we did with our own parents), it is comforting to feel they have some understanding of the aesthetic nature of the world and art’s ultimate capacity for salvation.

I light a cigarette and smoke on my balcony and listen to a vinyl. I contemplate the rain and realize that despite all the shit and cruelty in this fucked up world of ours, some moments are so precious that there must be a God or something greater than me, you, everyone. How do you feel about God? Really.

Next Question

Do you smoke?","Dear Dee and Susan,

 A couple of Bad Seeds tours ago, when I was trying to stop smoking, I limited myself to one cigarette a day. After the show, as soon as I came off stage, Jacek, my assistant, would escort me to a solitary chair in the back alley of the venue, where I would sit and roll a cigarette. With immense anticipation, I would light that little white stick of joy and inhale. There, in the Zen-like supremacy of the moment, on the road and adrift in this world, the nicotine would enter my bloodstream and with a blissful rush of pure meaning God would declare Himself to me – just as He did to you, Dee, on your balcony, at 21.49, on that rainy evening in Rosario, Argentina. That five minute interlude, puffing on a cigarette, in the deranged chaos of our lives – you on your balcony and me in some alley in some foreign city – was, to paraphrase Leonard Cohen, the crack where the light came in.

 So, how do I really feel about God? Well, the more absent He feels, and the more indifferent the cosmos appears to be, the more fervent and necessary my search for meaning becomes. For me though, the actual existence of God is beside the point – the argument between belief and disbelief does nothing to assuage the sadness and emptiness I sometimes feel in the face of existence. Prayer and meditation, however, do help me hugely, even if I am praying to a phantom or a memory or an invention. These acts of devotion, and investment in the unknowable, define my life. Whether God is my witness or whether He is not is not of my concern and has no real impact on the spiritual nature of my life. For me, the search itself is where the action is.

 As the Bad Seeds tour progressed I predictably began to seek my communion with God before the show as well, then in the middle of the day, until eventually I was jamming a cigarette in my mouth the moment I woke up, till the moment I went to sleep and I was back to a pack and a half a day – equally predictably God vanished and all I was left with was the age-old, fiendish cigarette habit, as I coughed and wheezed my way across Europe. After the tour I simply gave up and haven’t had a cigarette since.

 Now, I sometimes think I have discovered God in other situations. Sometimes I feel a certain divine presence and sometimes I don’t – but I still long for meaning and I still search. A fool’s mission maybe, but wherever this journey may lead, please Dee, next time you sit on the balcony with the rain coming down, put on a Bad Seeds record – something loud or something soft, it doesn’t matter – and light up a fag for me. I am with you in spirit.

Next Question

I am kinda involved with my third Nick Cave fan. They are all just, er, impossible to resist. Also my friends who are from the same universe say, “Nick Cave fans are just too kind and special”. What do you think about your fans?","Dear Florencia and You,

 When I stand on stage I feel a tremendous need emanating from the audience. I recognise this need because it exists within myself. I think we all see the opportunity for rapture and recognise its importance. Ultimately, this is a relationship of mutual dependence, that surpasses simple entertainment and moves into the domain of the sacred. I say this because the performative act, for me, is a process of peeling away one’s ego and self-importance, of letting go and laying oneself open to the audience, in a mutual acknowledgement of each other’s humanity. In doing so, a simple but profound connection is made. This connection is the responsibility of both the audience and the performer – we take each other’s hands and move beyond ourselves to a higher place of spiritual reciprocity in order to restore each other. If we can do this together, we have achieved something sublime.

 I feel that over time my audience and I have come to fully understand this relationship. I think we have brought each other to this heightened place, and we all feel a mutual and urgent call to traverse our individual suffering and just fucking lose ourselves. 

 Perhaps there are some performers who see the performative process as a one-way street, where the artist is dominant and simply delivers, whilst the passive audience receives. Personally, I do not see it in this way, at all. As the writer, Greil Marcus says, the performer needs “an aggressive, critical audience, with a conscious sense of itself as an audience, … one whose complexity and diverse needs can push an artist beyond comfortable limits.” This is how I experience it. I feel, on stage, that the audience is making me, just as I am making them, in an act of shared, primordial creation.

 As a consequence of this, Florencia, our fans have grown to be uniquely devotional, that is to say, devotional to the transcendent experience itself, just as the Bad Seeds and I are more devotional to the audience and their needs. We are all just completely needed and in need.

 And, You, from Xx, whoever you are and wherever you may be, be careful with that third Nick Cave fan you’re kinda involved with. Be nice. Treasure her or him. They are indeed kind and special people, full of a formidable beauty and may just end up being the very best part of you.

Next Question

How do you feel about the current trend of connecting the shortcomings of an artist’s personal conduct and the art they create and using that criteria to determine if said works are corrupted and therefore to be relegated to the dustbins or not?
What does it mean for the future of art if we expect our artists, those that help us collectively explore and understand the human experience, to be morally perfect and beyond reproach?","Dear Dylan and Jason,

 Rock music has lurched and shuddered its way through its varied and tumultuous history and somehow managed to survive. It is within the very nature of rock ‘n’ roll to mutate and to transform – to die so it can live again. This churning is what keeps the whole thing moving forward. As musicians we are always in danger of becoming obsolete and superseded by the next generation’s efforts, or by the world itself and its big ideas. Not so long ago the big idea in the world was freedom of expression. It looks like the new big idea is moralism. Will rock music survive this one? We shall see.

 My feeling is that modern rock music, as we know it, has anyway been ailing for some time now. It has become afflicted with a kind of tiredness and confusion and faint-heartedness, and no longer has the stamina to fight the great battles that rock music has always fought. It seems to me there is little new or authentic, as it becomes safer, more nostalgic, more cautious and more corporate.

 As far as rock music goes, I think that the new moral zealotry that is descending upon our culture could actually be a good thing. Maybe, it is exactly what rock ‘n’ roll needs at this moment in time. Contemporary rock music no longer seems to have the fortitude to contend with these enemies of the imagination, these enemies of art – and in this present form perhaps rock music isn’t worth saving. The permafrost of puritanism could be the antidote for the weariness and nostalgia that grips it. Perhaps a painful reckoning is needed – a great crushing of creativity that descends and lays its self-righteous ice across art – so that in time, a wild, dangerous and radical form of music can tear its way through the ice, teeth bared, and rock ‘n’ roll can get back to the business of transgression.

 Transgression is fundamental to the artistic imagination, because the imagination deals with the forbidden. Go to your record collection and mind-erase those who have led questionable lives and see how much of it remains. It is the artist who steps beyond the accepted social boundaries who will bring back ideas that shed new light on what it means to be alive. This is, in fact, the artist’s duty – and sometimes this journey is accompanied by a certain dissolute behaviour, especially in rock ‘n’ roll. In fact, the nature of rock ‘n’ roll is dissolute. Sometimes an individual’s behaviour is purely malevolent, and this surely needs to be exposed for what it is – and we must make a personal choice as to whether or not we engage with their work.

 However, in the world of ideas the sanctimonious have little or no place. Art must be wrestled from the hands of the pious, in whatever form they may come – and they are always coming, knives out, intent on murdering creativity. At this depressing time in rock ‘n’ roll though, perhaps they can serve a purpose, perhaps rock music needs to die for a while, so that something powerful and subversive and truly monumental can rise up out of it.

34,April 2019,https://www.theredhandfiles.com/what-does-elvis-mean-to-you,what-does-elvis-mean-to-you,1,GEORGIA,GLASGOW,UK,What does Elvis mean to you?,"Dear Georgia,

 In early 2000, I saw Johnny Cash walk into a studio in LA, old and ill and temporarily blind (he had toward the end of his life a condition that affected his sight), sit down and sing a song, then transform into a higher being. I have seen Nina Simone climb a flight of stairs to the stage at the Royal Festival Hall in London, barely able to walk, sit down at the piano and be transformed. I have seen Shane MacGowan stand on stage at a concert in France after taking ten LSD trips, and not knowing where he was, shuffle to the microphone, begin to sing so very beautifully, and be transformed. These transformative moments encapsulate the religious nature of performance as they imitate the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus Christ Himself. This narrative of suffering and rebirth is played out again and again within our own lives, but I believe it is captured most beautifully, within the musical performance itself. Through the boundless power of music, a performer transcends his or her own wretchedness by performing a kind of public exorcism and by doing so, transforms into a deity.

 In 1981, in London, I saw the movie This Is Elvis. I had always been an Elvis fan, with a special love for the songs he made in the seventies – Suspicious Minds, In the Ghetto, Kentucky Rain, Always on My Mind – and had a particular obsession with the gospel album, How Great Thou Art that he recorded in the early sixties. The last ten minutes of This Is Elvis changed my ideas on performance forever.

 In the final minutes of the film, we see Elvis, on stage in Las Vegas, sing the famous so-called ‘Laughing Version’ of Are You Lonesome Tonight? The camera begins with a long shot and does a slow zoom in on Elvis’s face. Elvis is stoned and overweight and by the time he performs the disastrous central monologue, we can see the pure anguish of his performance, the drugged and mortified eyes, the terrible aloneness, the horror of the moment – his vast soul crucified on the cross of his own body as he blunders through the words. It is one of the most traumatic pieces of footage I have ever seen. This is followed by the medley, An American Trilogy. Elvis dies and as the world media reports his death, we hear him sing Dixie over shots of his funeral procession. We see the motorcade, the weeping crowds, the coffin, and the flowers, as the film returns to the Vegas concert and Elvis sings the eternally beautiful All My Trials. To me it is immeasurably moving, Elvis’s head bowed, his extraordinary voice steeped in sorrow – then the band rises, he lifts his head and sings The Battle Hymn of the Republic and Elvis is resurrected, triumphant. It is pure religion and as powerful as anything I have ever seen. The final shot of him, in slow motion, arms outstretched, the angel wings of his silver cape flung wide, shows his exultant ascent into heaven.

 As I walked from the cinema, I was left with these three images – Elvis’s mortified, tear-streaked face; his head hung in sorrowful acceptance; and his caped arms outstretched in triumph. These are the stages of Christ’s passage upon the cross, the anguish, the sufferance and the resurrection, a journey which welcomes us all, in time.

 Elvis continued performing until the end. In my eyes, he was some kind of angel; both terribly and awfully human yet divine in his meteoric reach that touched so many hearts. He was fallible and God-like at the same time. He crucified himself on stage in Vegas, at the supper show and the late show, hundreds and hundreds of times. His latter years on Earth were as sad and lonely as any can be, but his Vegas performances were epic triumphs of human transcendence, where the angels looked down on one who had fallen so far, then looked up to where he ascended.

Next Question

Have you ever suffered a crisis of confidence?

Next Question

I hate myself sometimes and wonder why I even bother.

Next Question

Do you have a harsh inner critic?","I don’t know how many times I have been asked this question, or a version of it, in The Red Hand Files. Let me say this – the ‘harsh inner critic’ that you speak of is in no way unique to you. The truth is that virtually anybody who is trying to do anything worthwhile at all, especially creatively, has seated in his or her brain, a horrible homunculus that blows a dreadful little trumpet, and only knows one song – a song that goes, “You are not good enough. Why bother?” This evil little gnome is full of bad jazz, and is, in the words of author Sam Harris, “an asshole.” The enemy of aspiration, this atrocious inner voice demands you turn away from whatever your higher calling may be and become a second-rate, cut-price version of yourself. As your very own personal detractor it is deeply persuasive in its dark business. Many of us listen, many of us accept its message, and many of us throw up our hands and give in. The problem is, of course, that this inner voice, this monstrous homunculus, is you.

 The creative act is an act of war – but as much as this inner critic is your adversary, it is also fundamental to the creative process. It is what anyone worth their salt is doing battle with all the time – we are in a perpetual dogfight with the lesser version of ourselves. To lose the battle is to become the embodiment of the homunculus itself. Defeated, we do nothing but sit in perpetual judgment of the world, idly watching, as it goes down in flames. As vicious as this fight with our own selves may be, it is this very conflict that puts the blood in the art, the tears too, and carves the battle scars deep into the work itself.

 The world, for all its failings, is an extraordinary experiment in rampant human imagination. At its best, it exists because there were people who had the courage to follow through on an idea – who resisted the inner voice that said, “You are worthless. Why bother?”

 I’ve said it before. Beautiful ideas abound. These ideas swim around us, ideas that can be of immense utility to world. Some ideas have our singular names inscribed upon them and it is our responsibility to reach beyond our lesser selves to the brightest version of what we can be and breathe life into these ideas. This act of reaching is almost always accompanied by the wretched homunculus and its dreary anthem of personal incompetence, but it is our sacred duty, to turn around and kick this little fucker in the balls. The fight with the dark force inside us is the forge in which true art is formed.

The melodies and words are running around in my head, so excuse this letter if it’s kind of scrambled. You asked about love, Mack, and maybe that’s what love is right there – maybe songs are the parlance of love. Maybe that’s what we have conceived them for – to give a voice to this strange, inscrutable feeling that tears away at us, all our lives. I don’t know. Maybe some songs are the embodiment of love itself and that’s why they move us so deeply. They are simple, plainspoken, incendiary devices that bomb the heart to pieces – something other art forms can’t do with the same sudden and frightening precision.

 Our dear friend Dominique Issermann was photographing Susie, at our home in Brighton, for a fashion magazine. I was the designated assistant for the day and when I poked my head in the room to see if anyone wanted a cup of tea, Dominique asked me to go to the bedroom window and open the shutters to let the sunlight in. Susie was changing for the next shot and was naked under her robe and in a purely improvised act of subversion dropped the robe as I opened the shutters. Dominique, the most fast-thinking and attentive photographer I have ever met, snapped the picture – one photograph and that was it. We were not attempting to shoot an album cover, rather this was a moment snatched from time, which we promptly forgot about.

 The next day, as Susie and I sat with Dominique looking through the shots, we found this remarkable photograph. It instantly spoke to us, reminding me of Masaccio’s fresco, Expulsion from the Garden of Eden, a much-loved Old Testament story of mine, and I thought it would make a great cover for Push the Sky Away, as it felt in keeping with many of the record’s concerns. I showed it to the band and they seemed happy and everyone in my office loved it. So that was that, the Dominique Issermann picture became the cover.

 How lovely the cover is and how beautiful my wife looks – the animal stance, up on her toes, the defensive positioning of her arms, and her face hidden in her hair. It is a brave and unsettling picture pulsing with ambiguity, mythology and life, and is probably Susie’s most treasured shot of herself and a favourite of Dominique’s as well.

 When the record came out there was a flurry of disapproval from a handful of people that questioned why Susie was naked and I wasn’t, that it was exploitative and sexist, inferring that I had somehow forced Susie into taking the picture. I was flattered that there were people who thought I had Svengali-like powers over my wife, and could cast spells on her and do with her as I pleased, but sadly this is not the case. I would say, in fact, that the situation is completely the reverse.

 I understand why people may have found the cover disturbing, but in the end, beauty knows best – it leads us beyond our narrow notions of what is appropriate into the realms of the enigmatic and discomforting. Here, beauty creates a dissonance in the mind that inflames the imagination. This fire of the mind is the place where the angels and devils play happily together. I hope this is also the place where many of my songs reside.

 Dominique’s photo is an uncanny and haunting work, born of a happy accident and full of contradictions, that will be forever attached to Push the Sky Away and of which Susie and I are immensely proud.

 Much love, Nick

I am just feeling a great desire to give Susie a big hug from afar, and hope she knows that she has many things to look forward to, both in the lives of the Cave family and in her own career.","Dear Vivian,

 Susie is sitting across the kitchen table from me, humming to herself and knitting what looks like a scarf. I have just read her your very sweet message. She is confused to find that Denmark has now become part of Australia, but Google tells us that Denmark is a small coastal town in Western Australia with a population of 2,558 people. Susie says she wants to go there on holiday and hug you back.

 In One More Time With Feeling we see an interview with a woman who is new in her grief. I don’t think I could ever watch that piece of footage of Susie again. It was the very hardest part – to see, day by day, the uncontainable and merciless dimensions of grief. It is the very reason I am so careful when I reply on The Red Hand Files to people who have lost someone, because I have seen the tenuous hold that a grieving mother has on life itself. I have seen the paralysis and the terrible retreat from the world. I have seen life lived in a darkened room, essentially a tomb, crumpled around a memory, as if to be dead herself somehow brought her closer to the spirit of her departed child. I learned the appalling meaning of the words ‘inconsolable’ and ‘helpless’ – and I never knew a person could cry for so long.

 But I have also seen a woman ultimately step from that room, changed – defiant and scoured clean by grief; a woman with a mutinous and ferocious grace, now more open, daring and creative than ever; a woman who has simply defied the cosmic odds and bloomed.

 And I think that is what Susie and I want to say to those deep in grief, to the inconsolable. We want to say that, in spite of ourselves, life moves on. That in time we learn to absorb our loss, as a form of armouring, and that it can become our strength. That the very thing we thought would destroy us, now becomes a fierce source of creative power, as if our departed are breathing an essential energy through us, drawn from a wellspring deep within the trauma itself. We want to say that allowing this process of renewal to occur is the greatest gift we can give to those who have left us. We become the living vessels that carry their spirits, out of that dark and shuttered place, and release them into the heavens.

 Finally, we want to say that even though there are still the deep and sudden weeps – the flash floods – they don’t assert the same hold on us anymore, for we know they pass, as do all things.

 So, Vivian, to answer your question, “how is Susie doing?” Susie is doing okay. I watch her now, across from me, humming to herself and knitting a scarf and I am awed.

In what way did the profession of your father influence you as an artist and as a person?

Next Question

Do you believe in an afterlife? If not, what do you think happens when we die?","Dear Catherine, Michael and Theo,

 I am not sure what my ‘earliest’ memory was – rather I have a muddle of images from my childhood, that make no real sense to me at all. I remember seeing a decapitated chicken running around a chopping block; I remember my mother naming the flowers in our garden; I remember climbing up a wire fence, falling off and splitting open my head; I remember my father painting a theatre prop in the backyard; I remember the devastating feeling of letting go of my mother’s hand on the first day of kindergarten – these memories are part of a disjointed narrative that lives inside my head and that approximates my childhood. But mostly I just remember the feeling of my childhood – that it was free, uncomplicated and happy and that my parents loved me. I have one memory however that sits firmly in my mind because it was the same episode that played out over many nights.

 My father was involved in amateur theatre and this meant that some nights he was away from home. At some point he explained to me that he was performing in the play Oedipus. To my child’s mind that involved him dressing up in a cat outfit – as in Oedi-puss. Many nights I would lie awake in bed, waiting for my father to come home, and in the silent darkness, if I concentrated hard enough, I could hear my blood beating in my ears. I would imagine this sound was my father’s footsteps coming down the garden path. I imagined him in his cat suit arriving home and the rhythm of his steps comforted me and I would fall asleep.

 Does this memory speak to any thematic concerns? I don’t know. Probably. But I will say this. My father instilled in me the idea of the pre-eminence of creativity – that to create was an act of largesse that had the capacity to redeem the world, and that the pursuit of this path was a serious matter. My father despised cynicism. He felt that whatever a person decided to do in life, they needed to apply themselves fully to the task, and not fuck around. Admittedly, I took a fairly destructive and treacherous route on the way to understanding what he meant. But I know now. He meant that we are at war with the mundane and the uninspired, and that apathy and complacency are moral failings and that it is our urgent duty to be of service to the world. He meant that what we do in life has consequences, and that each of us are effectual and of great value. He believed in the sovereignty of the individual and felt that although we do not always have control over the things that happen to us, it is entirely our choice how we live our life in relation to them.

 Sometimes, Theo, I think, that if there is an after-life, it will have something to do with the worlds we have dreamed or imagined, especially as children. I think these luminous imaginings, these memories, are locked deep into our sub-conscious and that the infinite and enigmatic nature of consciousness and the possibility of an after-life are inextricably linked. At times, I think that when I die and my spirit leaves my body, searching for its guide, it will be met by a glimmering man in a cat suit walking down the garden path toward me.",https://www.theredhandfiles.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Picture1.png,OEDIPUS

 These days the word ‘evil’ is seen by many as anachronistic and outmoded. What much contemporary thought offers us is a representation of humanity as little more than a mass of twitching nerves, with no inherent purpose other than to merely exist, that there is no ultimate good or bad, and concepts such as evil are redundant social constructs. I disagree, of course, and I must answer your question through my own view of the world – that we are spiritual and transcendent beings, that our lives have meaning, and that our individual actions have vast implications on the well-being of the universe.

 Throwing tobacco in the eyes of an animal in a zoo is an act of deliberate malevolence, and in that respect, evil. However, I think we must all look inside ourselves and acknowledge that we each have a capacity for malevolence. It requires little self-examination to envisage a situation where ‘good’ people could – under certain circumstances – perform acts that are wicked. This acknowledgement of our own capacity for evil, difficult as it may be, can ultimately become our redemption. If we don’t acknowledge our potential for malevolence, we disconnect ourselves from the unlimited ability for good that is contained within us. It is important to understand that as individual human beings we hold, in our own hands, the ability to both destroy and save the world.

 The transcendent spirit for good can be accessed with profound effect through the imagination – the creative force can act as a counter-agent to evil. We cannot eradicate evil, yet it need not paralyse us – rather we should take what steps we can, however small, toward the betterment of the world, and our place in it. This is the essence of creativity.

 Sometimes, the world appears to lean deeper into its evilness and feels reductive and devoid of light, but Katja, your letter of concern is a small and subversive act of goodwill that can help tilt the world the other way. You are never helpless in the face of evil (unless you sit in perpetual condemnation of the world, as some sadly do). Your simple act of solicitude is the spark of kindness that can illuminate the entire universe. The world already feels brighter.

 The truth is it is very difficult to be sad on stage. When I walk on stage, I am thrust into the immediate moment – into the acute and astonishing now. I am seized by the enormous energy of the crowd, and the power of the music itself, where all memories disappear and the future does not exist. I am simply situated in the ecstatic present. I sing the songs with the utmost attention. I attempt to carry my audience with me, into the fullness of the moment, by applying complete concentration to the words. The words deliver their meaning, speaking to me afresh, as if for the first time, because the present moment is perpetually the first time. It is a state of blamelessness – a rapturous innocence – freed from what has gone before and what is yet to come.

 However, every now and then, a sudden thought, beyond my control, pierces this state of present-ness – a devastating image or a shocking recollection or an impossible wish – and that holy state of now ruptures and the world comes crashing in, and, well, sometimes you cry.

 And so it was at the Bad Seeds’ concert at the Manchester Arena, in your hometown, Sarah. I remember that concert so vividly. It was four months after the terrorist bombing, where twenty-three people died and untold were wounded, physically and psychologically. It was one of the first gigs in the Manchester Arena since it had re-opened, and there was a feeling of real defiance in the room, of course, but a terrible sadness too, I thought, at the sheer monstrousness of it all. A sadness because we understood that evil does walk among us, and that none of us has any real control over our destinies, that we are all tossed around by the arbitrary winds of fate and who ever really knows what is going to happen next?

 At that concert in Manchester Arena, with these thoughts going through my mind, I felt an intense common bond with the audience, that became in the end almost overwhelming and which I will never forget. The unrestrained release at the end of the show was a deliverance for us all.

 So to answer your question, Sarah, generally my own songs don’t make me cry, but sometimes I cry all the same. How can we not?

I saw you in Hobart in January 2017 and I’ll be there again to see you in January 2019. None of my friends listen to anything cool, interesting or beautiful. How will having your music in my life so early on affect me, and have you got any advice for me? Thank you.","Dear Ptolemy,

 I think I may have already answered your question at the In Conversations in Hobart – if you’re the little blonde kid, who was sitting on the right side of the hall. I can’t remember exactly what I replied, but I thought more about the question after the show, and I remember wishing I had answered it better.

 Perhaps, this is what I should have said. Listening to Bad Seeds music at your age is like having a secret knowledge. When I was about your age I had a secret knowledge too. My eldest brother, Tim, used to listen to a lot of very strange and obscure music and he passed this knowledge on to me. Back then I lived in a rural city in Victoria and it seemed to me that nobody my age listened to the music my brother played to me. As far as I could tell they all listened to a whole lot of shit. It was like I carried a secret around inside me, a special knowledge about the world that my friends didn’t have. It was a secret power. I carried this secret power with me all through my kid-years until I went to a school in Melbourne, where I met three or four other people who also had this special knowledge – this secret power. These people became my best friends and we went on to form a band and tried, in our way, to take this knowledge and pass it on to the world.

 This secret knowledge you have is a strength that lives only inside certain people. It is a strength that will inspire you to do wondrous things – like write stories, or draw pictures, or build rockets that fly to Mars. It will give you the courage to take on anything that the world might put in front of you. It’s a wild power that can be of untold value to the world. Your name, Ptolemy, is a warrior’s name. A boy full of inspiration with a warrior’s name! The world is waiting for you. Blow ‘em away, kid.

Next Question

During one of the ‘In Conversation’ events, you mentioned that you look to some poets for inspiration in your songwriting. Which ones?","Dear Astrid and Katie,

 I have always read a lot of poetry. It’s part of my job as a songwriter. I try to read, at the very least, a half-hour of poetry a day, before I begin to do my own writing. It jimmies open the imagination, making the mind more receptive to metaphor and abstraction and serves as a bridge from the reasoned mind to a stranger state of alertness, in case that precious idea decides to drop by.

 Sometimes the reading is something of a chore and there are many “great” poets I find boring, inscrutable, long-winded and painful to read. They can be bad news for the imaginative process.

 However, I have a few poets that, purely on a personal level, always delight and are a simple pleasure to read. There are enough surprises within their writing to keep the mind light and alive. This is by no means a definitive list and in no particular order. I’m just sitting here at my desk looking at my bookshelf, in fact. They are poets whose company I consistently enjoy.

  

 Stevie Smith

 Frederick Seidel

 William Blake

 Sherwood Anderson

 Rae Armantrout

 Langston Hughes

 E. E. Cummings

 W. B. Yeats

 John Berryman

 Sylvia Plath

 W. H. Auden

  

 Just to say, my list, in this instance, is of poets writing in the English language, for no other reason than to make the list more manageable.

 Beyond this list, there are various poetry anthologies which are always an education and an immense pleasure to dive into, most notably those put together by the great Jerome Rothenberg – among them Barbaric, Vast and Wild, Shaking the Pumpkin, A Big Jewish Book, America a Prophesy and Technicians of the Sacred.

24,February 2019,https://www.theredhandfiles.com/thoughts-of-your-legacy,thoughts-of-your-legacy,1,ANGELINA,BRISBANE,AUSTRALIA,"In your response to an audience question in Brisbane, I am bothered that you dismissed the idea of leaving a legacy – that it didn’t matter what you left behind. I’d like to challenge you on this. A body of artistic work, that has also had an enormous personal impact on the lives of many people – given meaning, comfort, joy and hope, and shaped their world views – is a legacy to be acknowledged and respected. Could you expand on your thoughts of your legacy?","Dear Angelina,

 I very much take your point – my answer was dismissive and unhelpful. As you point out, it undermined the relationship with my work that other people may have. I’m sorry about that. I very much appreciate you writing in and pushing back against my statement.

 What I should have said is that I am still actively engaged in the business of songwriting and doing everything in my power to stay afloat. This is not as easy as it may appear and involves a certain amount of self-deception. Part of that process is to occasionally affect a dismissive attitude toward my earlier songs, as if my best work is still ahead of me. How could I continue to write if I believed otherwise? Here, most probably, truth collides with necessity. We look to what ought to be rather than what is. The newly formed song needs all the support it can get to front up to the impossible weight of the hundreds of songs I have already written. Indeed, how can the new idea ever hope to compete with the deep attachment that people seem to have with those past and treasured songs?

 I am dancing on water lilies when I write and one’s heritage can have a terrifying tonnage. I must remain one step ahead of the songs, optimistically hopping from lily pad to lily pad, and doing my best to ignore the great dark wave of work that is building up behind me. How many artists have we seen stop and turn around to look, only to literally drown in a pool of their own legacy.

 I am sure a time will come, Angelina – perhaps in the not too distant future – when I can sit back like some loony old patriarch and cast a weepy eye over my legacy, as they wheel me on stage to receive my ‘Lifetime Achievement Award’, but not this year, please, I beg you, not this year.

23,January 2019,https://www.theredhandfiles.com/hard-to-find-happiness,hard-to-find-happiness,1,WILLIAM,BROOKLYN,USA,"Three and a half years ago I lost my wife and I was left to take care of my (then 2 year old) daughter. She’s a happy little girl but I know she’s happiest when her father is happy. I’ve been finding it hard to find happiness. It’s not my loss – I made peace with that a while back. I just haven’t found my life again. You’re a happy man. We all get that vibe when we see you play live. Has it always been this way, have you always been able to cut through the heavy moments in life to enjoy living?","Dear William,

 Thank you for your question. Please accept this answer, in the spirit that it is given, as a simple and supportive response to your letter.

 It seems to me that you are reacting entirely appropriately to a devastating situation that has ransacked your life. This is not what you signed up for when you got married – to be alone and looking after your little daughter. When you said that you have made peace with the death of your wife, this may on some level be true, but the residual feelings of aloneness, loss of control, and cosmic betrayal must still hold a powerful sway over your life. No wonder you can’t find your life. That life you once had does not exist. You have a new life.

 No wonder you can’t find your life. That life you once had does not exist. You have a new life.

 Three and a half years have passed, for both of us. We feel we should be better. We feel equilibrium should be restored. We feel we have in someway failed and that we should have made peace with the world. We feel people must be sick to death of us, and our fucking grief. But grief is beyond our control; it is omnipotent and invincible and we are miniscule in its presence and when it comes for us, all we can do is to kneel before it, heads bowed and await its passing.

 But, as you know, grief is also tidal. In time, it can recede and leave us with feelings of peace and advancement, only for it to wash back in with all its crushing hopelessness and sorrow. Back and forth it goes, but with each retreating drift of despair, we are left a little stronger, more resilient, more essential and better at our new life. I can feel these tides of anguish and restoration move through your words. They say so much about grief, but also the sanctity of fatherhood. What a glorious thing fatherhood is! Within your words, William, great hope resides, for you, for your daughter, and for us all.

 They say so much about grief, but also the sanctity of fatherhood. What a glorious thing fatherhood is!

 Nothing, of course, happens fast enough and we just want to be returned to that uncomplicated life we once had – we want stability restored – but it is not to be. Now we have a new life; unchartered, uncertain, beyond our control, and that we are on some level undertaking alone, even within the company of the ones we love. Our worlds are still raw and new. They hum with suffering, but there is immense power there too.

 We are alone but we are also connected in a personhood of suffering. We have reached out to each other, with nothing to offer, but an acceptance of our mutual despair. We must understand that the depths of our anguish signal the heights we can, in time, attain. This is an act of extraordinary faith. It makes demands on the vast reserves of inner-strength that you may not even be aware of. But they are there. As your little daughter dances through her father’s tears, she leads the way. The way lies there before us.

This sounds entirely feasible. However, he goes on to say that AI will be able to write better songs than humans can. He says, and excuse my simplistic summation, that we listen to songs to make us feel certain things and that in the future AI will simply be able to map the individual mind and create songs tailored exclusively to our own particular mental algorithms, that can make us feel, with far more intensity and precision, whatever it is we want to feel. If we are feeling sad and want to feel happy we simply listen to our bespoke AI happy song and the job will be done.

 But, I am not sure that this is all songs do. Of course, we go to songs to make us feel something – happy, sad, sexy, homesick, excited or whatever – but this is not all a song does. What a great song makes us feel is a sense of awe. There is a reason for this. A sense of awe is almost exclusively predicated on our limitations as human beings. It is entirely to do with our audacity as humans to reach beyond our potential.

 A sense of awe is almost exclusively predicated on our limitations as human beings.

 It is perfectly conceivable that AI could produce a song as good as Nirvana’s Smells Like Teen Spirit, for example, and that it ticked all the boxes required to make us feel what a song like that should make us feel – in this case, excited and rebellious, let’s say. It is also feasible that AI could produce a song that makes us feel these same feelings, but more intensely than any human songwriter could do.

 But, I don’t feel that when we listen to Smells Like Teen Spirit it is only the song that we are listening to. It feels to me, that what we are actually listening to is a withdrawn and alienated young man’s journey out of the small American town of Aberdeen – a young man who by any measure was a walking bundle of dysfunction and human limitation – a young man who had the temerity to howl his particular pain into a microphone and in doing so, by way of the heavens, reach into the hearts of a generation. We are also listening to Iggy Pop walk across his audience’s hands and smear himself in peanut butter whilst singing 1970. We are listening to Beethoven compose the Ninth Symphony while almost totally deaf. We are listening to Prince, that tiny cluster of purple atoms, singing in the pouring rain at the Super Bowl and blowing everyone’s minds. We are listening to Nina Simone stuff all her rage and disappointment into the most tender of love songs. We are listening to Paganini continue to play his Stradivarius as the strings snapped. We are listening to Jimi Hendrix kneel and set fire to his own instrument.

 We are listening to Jimi Hendrix kneel and set fire to his own instrument.

 What we are actually listening to is human limitation and the audacity to transcend it. Artificial Intelligence, for all its unlimited potential, simply doesn’t have this capacity. How could it? And this is the essence of transcendence. If we have limitless potential then what is there to transcend? And therefore what is the purpose of the imagination at all. Music has the ability to touch the celestial sphere with the tips of its fingers and the awe and wonder we feel is in the desperate temerity of the reach, not just the outcome. Where is the transcendent splendour in unlimited potential? So to answer your question, Peter, AI would have the capacity to write a good song, but not a great one. It lacks the nerve.

Next Question

Nocturama? What the fuck?!!","Dear Delilah, Anne, Miguel and Faduma,

 Nocturama is held in such universal contempt that its very title has become a byword for failure or disaster. “He tried his best but ultimately he met his Nocturama,” you may hear someone say, or perhaps “What a complete and utter Nocturama!” As the years have passed, the disdain for this record has not diminished, and Nocturama has become just another word for ‘loser’ – as in “Fuck you, you fucking Nocturama!” and still it continues to this day, so that when a Bad Seeds fan gets poked in the eye or kicked in the nuts, they cry, “Nocturama!”

 Therefore it comes as no surprise that many of the questions I have received on The Red Hand Files circle around the failings of this sad, brave, little record.

 Personally, I like Nocturama. I like that it is out there, moving around the place and spoiling things. I like it that someone may accidently play it at a party and people start throwing up in the ashtrays. I like it that everyone stands upwind from it. I especially like it that of the sixteen records the Bad Seeds have produced we only have one Nocturama, whereas with some bands half their records are Nocturamas, and with most bands all of their records are Nocturamas.

 I think that in the end we all need our Nocturamas. Your Nocturama may, indeed, be the most important thing you ever do. Failure fortifies us. It moves us forward. It strips everything back to its essential nature and leaves us clean and pure, ready to begin again. You don’t create something as problematic as Nocturama without a certain risk and a little courage and the temerity to fail. I love this troubled record for that. It may just be my favourite.

If you were a flower, which one would you be?","Dear Jonathan and Gisela,

 I’m writing this very early in the morning from Brisbane. I played an ‘In Conversations’ show last night and sat up talking with people afterwards.

 As I take these events around the country, I am meeting audiences who are asking thoughtful, fearless and challenging questions, many of which have resonated deeply with me. So it is with The Red Hand Files. When I started the Files I had a small idea that people were in need of more thoughtful discourse. I felt a similar need. I felt that social media was by its nature undermining both nuance and connectivity. I thought that, for my fans at least, The Red Hand Files could go some way to remedy that. The number and breadth of questions I have received over the last three months has been staggering, indeed, many are not questions at all, but people using the Files to tell their own stories. It is a privilege to read these pieces of writing and it is both a pleasure and an honour to stand on stage before you all.

 And now, to your question, Gisela!

 If I had to be a flower, I would be a bluebell.

 I remember lying under the old Yew tree in Kew Gardens with my wife, Susie, in a vast field of bluebells. It was year 2000 and we would visit the gardens often that spring. It was a magical time, full of excitement and promise. Susie was heavily pregnant with the twins and we could barely contain ourselves, as we lay there in the shade of the ancient tree, with the children growing inside her, as the momentary bluebells looked on.

  

 Now we sit beneath the knotted Yew

 And the bluebells bob around our shoes

You took such a risk. I would love to know how it was for you?","Dear Jenny,

 As I drove into Wangaratta, the town I grew up in, with my eighteen year old son sitting beside me, Ausmuteants blaring through the sound system, I had an uncanny, dizzying feeling that my childhood was no longer in the past, as one would expect, but rolling out in front of me, and the child I thought I could see shimmering in the heat and walking down the road toward me, was, in fact, myself.

 It was nearly fifty years ago that I left Wangaratta and I was anxious about a lot of things, but mostly that this town I had conjured up so many times in my songs and novels would be unrecognisable to me now. I was anxious that my imagination might have overridden the truth of the town to fit the narrative purposes of my songs. I was afraid that it would feel as if I were simply in the wrong place – that it would feel unauthentic, a fabrication – so long have I lived away from the town and so long I have lived inside my songs.

 But as we drove around the town and visited the places I knew so well as a child – the Railway Hotel, the Wangaratta Cathedral, the rusted railway bridge, the High School, the muddy Ovens River, the swimming pool, my house in Mepunga Ave – I was amazed at how little the town had changed and how close to the truth my songs actually were. It seemed to me, that so many of the songs and stories I had written were simply guides to “the idea of a river, an open space and a small town” in the North East of Victoria.

 But still the strange feeling of vertigo persisted. I felt that I had caught up to the vision of the child shimmering on the road in the sun and found that it was my childhood self – and that child would be the one who would take my hand and lead me back through the old town, who would show me around; but further than that, my child-self would tug at my sleeve, and guide me down to the river and ultimately, in the final hour, take me across it, to the other side, wherever that may be.

 When I stood on stage in Wangaratta, I was overcome by the warmth of the audience and their total lack of resentment for some of the unfortunate things I had said about Wangaratta in the past. These were foolish things to say because these comments were not just an affront to the town itself but to the child that inhabited the town, for indeed these two things are one and the same.

 When I visited the cathedral, where I had spent every Sunday morning and Tuesday night yawning my way through morning mass and evensong as a chorister, I was overwhelmed – this holy place had, without me even knowing it, forged so many of my ideas about the world that remain true to me to this day. The Dean of the church had kindly opened it for us. He had come to the church because someone had snapped the head off the plaster baby Jesus in the Christmas Nativity scene. “He’s been decapitated,” said the Dean, quietly. We have made contact with the church to offer a contribution to help restore the infant Jesus’ head to his body. It seems the very least I can do, all things considered.

 So, Jenny, to answer your question – to stand before the people of Wangaratta was a special kind of privilege. It felt restorative, like a circle completed.

 With love, Nick

 In my extended poem, “The Sick Bag Song”, I wrote about Leonard Cohen and the effect that he had on me as a young boy when I first heard him sing.

 “Leonard Cohen will sing, and the boy will suddenly breathe as if for the first time, and fall inside the laughing man’s voice and hide.

 The boy will grow older, and over time there will be other songs – not many – ten or maybe twenty in a lifespan, that stand apart from the rest of the music he will discover. He will realise that not only are these songs sacred, they are ‘hiding songs’ that deal exclusively in darkness, obfuscation, concealment and secrecy. He will realise that for him the purpose of these songs was to shut off the sun, to draw a long shadow down and protect him from the corrosive glare of the world.”

 Occasionally people have asked me what those ‘hiding songs’ were. I have never revealed them in their entirety. Perhaps, I felt a strange ownership over them and that to release them to the world may constitute a form of betrayal. Do you ever feel like that about songs – that they were designed with you especially in mind, and that no one could ever begin to understand them in the way you do? My ‘hiding songs’ serve as a form of refuge for me and have done so for years. They are songs that I can pull over myself, like a child might pull the bed covers over their head, when the blaze of the world becomes too intense. I can literally hide inside them. They are the essential pillars that hold up the structure of my artistic world. There are hundreds of other favourite songs, of course, and one day maybe I can do a list of some of those, but not today. Today, I give you the ‘hiding songs’.

 G and William (and anyone else, for that matter), I’d be interested to know if you have any ‘hiding songs’, and if so what they are. You know where to find me!

You say you would freak the fuck out when you heard that you have only 72 hours to live. I don’t hear you writing anything about your sons and the other band members. Did you forget them?,"Dear Carolina,
Just to be clear, I did in fact mention my sons in the second Freak The Fuck Out answer – Issue #12. I said, “I would gather my family together, hold them tightly, and speak some comforting words…” The family I am referring to is my wife and my sons.

 You are, however, correct in pointing out that I omitted to mention my band members and, as I read your question, I felt a pang of shame to think that we were all going to be atomised in 72 hours and I had not attempted to say goodbye to them. In my defence, there are very real problems in contacting The Bad Seeds. Firstly, only George answers the phone when I call. Tommy & Marty rarely go near telephones – Tommy has full-blown telephobia and the ever-elusive Marty hasn’t, as far as I can tell, unboxed the Apple iPhone XS Max recently bought for him (at great expense) by our management. Larry only does social media, which I don’t know how to do, and to contact Jim, I have to go through his wife, who I like very much, but who isn’t speaking to me at the moment. Warren and I are so spiritually aligned that we communicate telepathically, which is fortunate as he never rings me back when I call, rather he messages me saying he will ‘call back later’, which he rarely, if ever, does. I have a terrible, lurking suspicion that none of The Bad Seeds like me very much. What I should – or would – therefore do, is contact my assistant, Rachel, and have her send out a group email. The email would say:

 Dear Bad Seeds,

 As we only have 72 hours until our mutual annihilation, I will keep this brief. You are the very best there is. It has been an honour working with you.

 With love to you all,

 Nick

 PS After much thought I have decided to give you all a bonus. It will be deposited into your account within three working days.

 Then, I would go back to my family – my wife, my sons, my dogs, my Brian Eno records – and continue to freak the fuck out!

You are wearing checked pants; you have your arm around a woman who appears to be stately and warm, in a very beautiful understated woollen coat. I think it is your mother. May I ask what was the most helpful advice she gave you? What of her words do you hold dear?

Next Question

Please tell me something that will help me not care when people stare at me because I look different to everybody else?","Dear Catherine and Bam,

 My mother gave me much advice over the years on how to live a decent life. Sadly, I didn’t take that much notice of it. Mostly though, she simply allowed me to be myself, to make my own mistakes and to find my own way. She served, and still serves, as a reminder that it is entirely possible to lead an ethical life where we can be kind and careful and welcoming and, most of all, take responsibility for our actions and not complain or blame others for our own misfortunes. She continues to lead a life of great integrity – she is ninety-two – but it is not without a certain acerbic humour and a wry eye for the absurdities of the world.

 But there was one piece of advice my mother gave me some years ago that affected me deeply and was of enormous practical value in my life. I can’t tell you how often I have brought it to mind and acted accordingly, and how much strength and moral fortitude it has afforded me. So often I have read questions in The Red Hand Files from people who feel lost, marginalised, lonely, scared of their creative impulses, freakish, less than, manipulated, silenced, bullied at school and all the rest, and my mother’s words often come to mind.

 I had been awarded an honorary doctorate by Monash University in Melbourne and my mother accompanied me to the university to receive it. I was feeling a little intimidated by the whole thing because I was stepping out of my rock ‘n’ roll comfort zone, in-to the academic sphere and the whole affair had me feeling quite uncomfortable. I mentioned this to my mother, and as we stepped out of the car into the university grounds, she said,

 “Head high and fuck ‘em all.”

 I am passing this crucial piece of maternal wisdom on to you Bam and Catherine – and to the rest of you out there. It is my mother’s gift to you.

 I have received a number of messages broadly relating to this issue, so perhaps this is an opportunity to address this matter by sharing some actual correspondence I had with Brian Eno about it. After announcing my decision to play two shows in Israel at the end of my world tour last year, Brian emailed me in the hope of persuading me to reconsider this decision. Below is my reply, which may go some way to answering your question.
 

 Dear Brian,

 Clearly the decision for The Bad Seeds to play in Israel is contentious for some people. But to be clear on this: I do not support the current government in Israel, yet do not accept that my decision to play in the country is any kind of tacit support for that government’s policies. Nor do I condone the atrocities that you have described; nor am I ignorant of them. I am aware of the injustices suffered by the Palestinian population, and wish, with all people of good conscience, that their suffering is ended via a comprehensive and just solution, one that involves enormous political will on both sides of the equation.

 But I also do not support the Boycott, Divestments and Sanctions movement, as you know. I think the cultural boycott of Israel is cowardly and shameful. In fact, this is partly the reason I am playing Israel – not as support for any particular political entity but as a principled stand against those who wish to bully, shame and silence musicians. I don’t intend to engage in a detailed discussion as to how the boycott of Israel can be seen to be anti-Semitic at heart and, furthermore, does not work (rather, it risks further entrenching positions in Israel in opposition to those you support), but even the estimable Noam Chomsky considers the BDS as lacking legitimacy and inherently hypocritical. What we actually have here is a fundamental difference of opinion as to what the purpose of music is.

 It struck me while writing this how much more powerful a statement you could make if you were to go to Israel and tell the press and the Israeli people how you feel about their current regime, then do a concert on the understanding that the purpose of your music was to speak to the Israeli people’s better angels. That would have a much greater effect than a boycott. Now imagine if the 1,200 UK artists who signed your list did the same thing. Perhaps the Israelis would respond in a wholly different way than they would to just yet more age-old rejectionism. Ultimately, whatever the rights and wrongs of official Israeli action in the disputed territories, Israel is a real, vibrant, functioning democracy – yes, with Arab members of parliament – and so engaging with Israelis, who vote, may be more helpful than scaring off artists or shutting down means of engagement.

 All the best to you,

 Nick

 I want to just add that Brian Eno, beyond any other musician, taught my friends and me how to make music. The records he made remain some of the most important and essential recordings I have ever heard. So, if there seems to be a thread of anguish that runs through this letter, this is indeed the case. I am writing to my hero.

 Even so, certain questions need to be asked. How far must we have strayed from the transformative nature of music to feel justified in weaponising music and using it to punish ordinary Israeli citizens for the actions of their government. Furthermore, what has brought us to the point where certain musicians feel it is ethically sound to use forms of coercion and intimidation, in the form of ‘open’ letters, on fellow musicians who don’t agree with their point of view?

 Occasionally, I wonder if The Bad Seeds did the right thing in playing Israel. I cannot answer that question. I understand and accept the validity of many of the arguments that are presented to me. Indeed, some of my dearest friends in the music industry found my decision very difficult to accept, but there it is, after much consideration the decision was made: I simply could not treat my Israeli fans with the necessary contempt to do Brian Eno’s bidding.

12,December 2018,https://www.theredhandfiles.com/freak-out-the-whole-72-hours,freak-out-the-whole-72-hours,1,JAMES,SKIPTON,ENGLAND,"In response to Elettra of Berlin (Issue #8), you said you’d “freak the fuck out” if the world were about to end in 72 hours. Great answer. But would that be for the whole 72 hours?","Dear James,

 Okay, good point. First off, I would investigate the person who was making the claim to see if they were a reliable source of information and not some lunatic on the street with a cardboard sign. If the person making the claim seemed credible, I would look at the reason why the world was going to end. If it was scientific in nature such as an impact event with an asteroid (which would make sense since we had been given 72 hours notice), rather than say, a random nuclear attack (where we would be given no such warning), or AI undermining us to the point of non-existence, or over-population, or all humans losing the will to live at the same time (a distinct possibility), or a catastrophic fungal pandemic, or extreme weather (all of which would happen incrementally, not in exactly 72 hours) then I would go to the appropriate channels and check out the science.

 If there was a consensus among scientists, who, after all, are in the business of knowing stuff – stuff like, for example, climate change, the mother of all apocalyptic fears, where 97% of scientists ascribe the cause to humankind – I would probably take their word for it and not be so negligent as to deny their projection.

 I would then proceed to do everything I could to stop it. I would make a call to my friend Bono. If even Bono couldn’t stop it, and there was simply no hope – with annihilation absolutely and unambiguously inevitable – I would gather my family together, hold them tightly and speak some comforting words. I would take their hands and pray quietly for a moment, because collective prayer can have a calming effect, and I would pray to the possibility of a god, and that the afterlife was a Christian one (where my family and I may have a slim chance of getting in) and not a Muslim one (where we wouldn’t) or a Hindu one (where we may all come back as cockroaches) or a Jewish one (which, as far as I can make out, is pretty much bad news for everyone).

 I would ring my mother. I would pet the dogs. I would then turn to my wife, look into her lovely eyes, push a strand of hair from her face and quietly tell her that I loved her, have always loved her and would continue to love her till the end of the world. Then, and only then, would I, with great force of meaning and extreme prejudice, freak the fuck out.

Is there any way you can explain your faith?

Next Question

Do you believe in God? I mean personal, not through your songs.

Next Question

Does God exist?

Next Question

Can it be you’ve given up the quest for God?","Dear Ali, Maggie, João and Peter and the many people who have asked similar God related questions.

 I’ve been circling around the idea of God for decades. It’s been a slow creep around the periphery of His Majesty, pen in hand, trying to write God alive. Sometimes, I think, I have almost succeeded. The more I become willing to open my mind to the unknown, my imagination to the impossible and my heart to the notion of the divine, the more God becomes apparent. I think we get what we are willing to believe, and that our experience of the world extends exactly to the limits of our interest and credence. I am interested in the idea of possibility and uncertainty. Possibility, by its very nature, extends beyond provable facts, and uncertainty propels us forward. I try to meet the world with an open and curious mind, insisting on nothing other than the freedom to look beyond what we think we know.

 I think we get what we are willing to believe.

 Does God exist? I don’t have any evidence either way, but I am not sure that is the right question. For me, the question is what it means to believe. The thing is, against all my better judgement, I find it impossible not to believe, or at the very least not to be engaged in the inquiry of such a thing, which in a way is the same thing. My life is dominated by the notion of God, whether it is His presence or His absence. I am a believer – in both God’s presence and His absence. I am a believer in the inquiry itself, more so than the result of that inquiry. As an extension of this belief, my songs are questions, rarely answers.

 In the end, with all respect, I haven’t the stomach for atheism and its insistence on what we know. It feels like a dead end to me, unhelpful and bad for the business of writing. I share many of the problems that atheists have toward religion – the dogma, the extremism, the hypocrisy, the concept of revelation with its many attendant horrors – I am just at variance with the often self-satisfied certainty that accompanies the idea that God does not exist. It is simply not in my nature. I have, for better or for worse, a predisposition toward perverse and contradictory thinking. Perhaps this is something of a curse, but the idea of uncertainty, of not knowing, is the creative engine that drives everything I do. I may well be living a delusion, I don’t know, but it is a serviceable one that greatly improves my life, both creatively and otherwise.

 So, do I believe in God? Well, I act like I do, for my own greater good. Does God exist? Maybe, I don’t know. Right now, God is a work in progress.

10,November 2018,https://www.theredhandfiles.com/subconscious-dreams-imagery,subconscious-dreams-imagery,1,IRINA,LONDON,UK,In your ‘notebook full of words’ do you record pieces of your subconscious? I wonder what your dreams look like and how much they influence the imagery of your writing.,"Dear Irina,

 Vicious killers had kidnapped Warren. The kidnappers had emailed me a list of demands. I had to write a letter back agreeing to their demands. The letter I was composing was in exactly the same format as a Red Hand Files issue, with the same blood red Cambria font, the same cream coloured background. The problem was I was having a technical issue formatting the letter. The letters kept scrambling. The font kept changing. The little red hand logo wouldn’t stand up. Time was running out. I woke up, shaking.

 I had read your question regarding dreams before I went to sleep that night. Your question must have provoked this dream, as it is the first remembered dream I have had in a very long time.

 We are professional dreamers. We work, therefore we dream.

 I think there is a reason for this. As a songwriter, most of my waking life is spent in a kind of dream time. Many writers will tell you the same. We are professional dreamers. We work, therefore we dream. Even when I am not at my desk writing, and am going about my ‘normal’ life, the residual trails of the words I’ve been working on still weave around me like dreams.

 For this reason, my actual dreaming while asleep does not feel particularly active. At least, not at the moment. I hardly ever remember anything I dream and if I do, images that are thrown up are rarely useful in my work. I never write them down.

 Having said that, I wrote this dream down. It’s for you. Thank you for awakening it. I rang Warren. He seems to be okay.

9,November 2018,https://www.theredhandfiles.com/creativity-disappears-coax-it-back,creativity-disappears-coax-it-back,1,JO,TORONTO,CANADA,Are there times your creativity disappears and if so how do you coax it back / jump start it?,"Dear Jo,

 Creativity is not something that can disappear. The creative impulse is simply the strategy used to catch ideas. Ideas are everywhere and forever available, provided you are prepared to accept them. This takes a certain responsibility to the artistic process. There is discipline and rigour and preparation involved. You must prove yourself worthy of the idea.

 I have rarely sat down at my desk with something to say, other than I am ready. The sitting comes first, turning up with a certain alertness to possibility. Only then does the idea feel free to settle. It settles small and very tentatively, then, through your active attention, it can grow into something much bigger. Sitting in a readied state can sometimes last a long and anxious time. But you must not despair! I have never found a situation where the idea refuses to come to the prepared mind.

 While you are in this prepared state, be the thing you want to be. If it is a writer, then write. Initially, stream of consciousness is fine. Write without judgement and self-condemnation. Write playfully and recklessly. Even if this initial writing appears of little value, keep going, for the beautiful idea has awakened and is moving toward you, as it responds to your display of intent.

 The idea is especially designed for you in your uniqueness. If you are not there to receive it, or indeed you are not yourself when it arrives or, heaven forbid, disguised as someone else, the idea may scare and vanish away and be lost forever. It is you that it is searching for and you alone. Be yourself. The idea is moving closer.

 Ideas are timid things, in my experience. They come as whispers and you need to hold them in honest regard in order to receive them. Perhaps the idea is as scared as you. Perhaps the idea is as invisible as you may sometimes feel. It may be that the idea is simply mirroring your internal self and is reluctant to settle in a mind that is heavy with uncertainty, and that is repeating ancient mantras of self-doubt. These voices can best be banished by a spirited disobedience, a playful defiance. Disobey the voices by continuing to write. They are a lot less robust than they appear. The idea is closing in.

 So, Jo, here are some suggestions as to what to do:

 Sit down. Be yourself. Be prepared. Be attentive. Defy the voices. Be the thing you want to be. Write. Be playful. Be reckless. Remember that you are uniquely designed for the idea that is moving toward you. You are good enough. The idea is about to arrive.

7,November 2018,https://www.theredhandfiles.com/women-relationships-influence,women-relationships-influence,1,MERRITT,DALLAS,"TX, USA","How have the topics of women, consent, and relationships in general changed in your works during the cultural sea changes (such as the one we are experiencing now)? I ask this not only because of current events, but also because throughout all the iterations of your work, you have addressed women with adoration, irreverence, worship, disdain, respect, horror, empathy and well, the list goes on. It’s a fascinating range in general, especially for someone who seems to clearly be a supporter of women, female artists, and a bit of the misandry. (And, as a woman, it’s refreshing to have all those representations from one artist.)","Dear Merritt,

 Thank you for your kind words. I find them very encouraging because, every now and then, my songs draw the disdain of certain people who believe that the way I represent women in my songs is reductive and objectifying and somehow does insult to the notion of womanhood. I think at heart they may feel a discomfort at the undue interest I pay to women in my songs – and to give the devil his due, women are indeed a singular obsession.

 The truth is I have very little understanding of women at all, they remain deep mysteries containing multitudes – and this is exactly why I enjoy writing about them. It is their feral energy and their seemingly limitless capacity for wonder that, for me, is their undying attraction, both on the page and off. Twenty years on and I am still trying to define Susie, my wife, in song, but it’s a losing battle. I have come to see that there is a wild and mercurial energy within her that my words will never contain, and that this bright energy is connected to her own singular and restless fascination with the world. It has little to do with me.

 As to the recent “cultural sea changes” affecting women, I feel that they are in danger of eroding those bright edges of personhood, and grinding them down into monotonous identity politics – where some women have traded in their inherent wildness and sense of awe, for a one-size-fits-all protestation against a uniform concept of maleness which I’m not sure I recognise.

 Whatever happened between us, it saddens me that something of our individual nature has disappeared into the divide, our unique voices are being worn down and everyone is communicating within the safe and strident anti-wonder of grievance politics.

 As to whether this cultural sea change would make me more cautious with what I write, well, I’m not sure. It feels like time itself serves as a sort of corrective and there are lyrics I wrote back then which I simply wouldn’t write now, just as my younger self would probably look at what I write now and roll his crazed and blood-shot eyes in scorn. I would hope that the general shift in my lyrics is towards a compassion that is human by nature, rather than tribal. That is not divisive or exclusionary, but for everyone. I hope that some of the songs may even draw on that fierce feminine energy – a particular energy I witness when I perform on stage – and also that special sense of female wonder.

 Love, Nick
 

 

 Once I married Susie, I set about trying to capture her. To write about Susie feels like trying to break a code that is constantly rearranging itself. Most of the time, I fail. My songs end up as scraps of paper rustling around the feet of a sixty-foot woman.

 I never show her a lyric before it is recorded. This is a matter of survival. I don’t show anybody, anything, actually. I write the lyric, record it with the Bad Seeds, and then offer up the finished songs.

 Playing the completed record to Susie for the first time is part pleasure, part terror for both of us. It is difficult to exaggerate how much I care what she thinks and, of course, she knows that I do. I suspect the pressure on her at this moment is immense as she navigates the terminal insecurities of her husband.

 Yet the music plays, and the songs come to the rescue and Susie falls inside them and loses herself and sometimes they even get the tears rolling. And there is the pleasure! I suspect some of those tears are tears of relief. Mine are.

 Love, Nick.

They are helping me. Are you and Susie feeling that your son Arthur is with you and communicating in some way?","Dear Cynthia,

 This is a very beautiful question and I am grateful that you have asked it. It seems to me, that if we love, we grieve. That’s the deal. That’s the pact. Grief and love are forever intertwined. Grief is the terrible reminder of the depths of our love and, like love, grief is non-negotiable. There is a vastness to grief that overwhelms our minuscule selves. We are tiny, trembling clusters of atoms subsumed within grief’s awesome presence. It occupies the core of our being and extends through our fingers to the limits of the universe. Within that whirling gyre all manner of madnesses exist; ghosts and spirits and dream visitations, and everything else that we, in our anguish, will into existence. These are precious gifts that are as valid and as real as we need them to be. They are the spirit guides that lead us out of the darkness.

 I feel the presence of my son, all around, but he may not be there. I hear him talk to me, parent me, guide me, though he may not be there. He visits Susie in her sleep regularly, speaks to her, comforts her, but he may not be there. Dread grief trails bright phantoms in its wake. These spirits are ideas, essentially. They are our stunned imaginations reawakening after the calamity. Like ideas, these spirits speak of possibility. Follow your ideas, because on the other side of the idea is change and growth and redemption. Create your spirits. Call to them. Will them alive. Speak to them. It is their impossible and ghostly hands that draw us back to the world from which we were jettisoned; better now and unimaginably changed.

Ya know, polish off the ol’ guitar and give the music world a huge middle finger and sweat like a Fourth of July whore in heat?","Dear Marvin,

 Many of you have asked about the reformation of Grinderman, although most not with the same lurid flair as you, so I sat with Warren and we discussed whether it was a good idea. We both thought the world needed Grinderman, considering its current emotional climate. Warren wanted to wait until Trump got re-elected, in the hope he would invite us to play ‘No Pussy Blues’ at the presidential celebrations. I’m not sure if he was joking or not. I personally felt there was no urgency, and that the older we got, the better Grinderman would be – the more deranged, the more priapic, and the more morally dubious. We both thought that Grinderman appeared to be a lot more popular now than when it existed, and we wondered whether that was simply the band passing into folklore, or whether the world had become, in the last years, more puritanical, less playful, and more hypersensitive, and that there were a lot of people out there, like you Marvin, who just wanted to listen to a band that fucked things up a bit.

 We both thought releasing a Best of Grinderman record was a good idea. We thought it should be a double album.

 Finally, we both didn’t know what a Fourth of July whore was.

  

 

 

 I guess, if I were to look under the bed for monsters, I might expect to find some Islamic terrorists, some man-hating feminists, Trump, some rampant AI, some cyber criminals, some neo-Marxist left-wing radicals, some chemical weapons, some right-wing Nazis, Putin, a nuclear explosion, a meteor, a melted ice cap, heaps of murdered farm animals, Roger Waters, and some very, very bad weather – but actually I think what I would probably find, staring back at me, is myself, because most monsters I have ever had to deal with were usually a product of bad thinking, and generally of my own making. Maybe my greatest fear is that there is nothing under the bed at all, just a vast and monstrous vacancy – dustballs, a child’s lost sock, and the ashy residue of dreams. Sometimes, I would rather not look.

 

 Dear Ben,

 Obviously you are acquainted with this wonderful book, so this letter is really to the uninitiated! Technicians of the Sacred by Jerome Rothenberg is an anthology of spiritual writings from around the world. It is probably the single most important book on poetry I have ever read. It has been a heavy influence over my songwriting – more than I’d like to admit. If there is anyone out there struggling to write lyrics, get your hands on this book; immerse yourselves in it, live inside it for a while, free your mind, and you will emerge brimming with ideas. Jerome Rothenberg recently released a revised edition of Technicians, so it is easily available. For those of you who are interested, this is well worth investigating.

  

 

 THE GREAT JEROME ROTHENBERG AND HIS WIFE DIANE, ENCINITAS, CA, USA.

 

 Around 2012, I visited Madame Tussauds Waxworks in Hollywood with my eleven-year-old kids. They became very excited about the waxwork statues of Hannah Montana and Miley Cyrus. They explained to me – although not in exactly these terms – that Hannah Montana was the child self, and that Miley Cyrus was the infanticidal adult self, who literally became a wrecking ball that obliterated her younger persona. In my mind, the Miley Cyrus that floats in the swimming pool in the gated community of Toluca Lake, in the song ‘Higgs Boson Blues’, is a statue made of wax. She is neither dead nor alive. She bobs about in the cool water, circled by pink Amazonian dolphins, and melts under a terrible, blank Californian sky, like a pagan sacrifice to an Aztec Sun God. I hope that clears things up a bit, dear Stephanie.

 

 Dear Lars,
I have printed your piece of writing in its entirety. Your efforts deserve as much. I have nothing to add, although perhaps I could talk briefly about the strange alliance between boredom and epiphany. Boredom is often dismissed as a lack of imagination – this is not true. Boredom is a signal that we are indeed imaginative creatures, and that the existential distress of being in a state of blah is often the mind readying itself for the epiphany. In your case, Lars, you were ‘terribly bored’. Boredom provoked you to action. You did your crazy statistics. You arrived at the conclusion that love is the essence of everything. By doing so, you have moved the world one step closer to its redemption. Congratulations! You are awesome!

  

  

 Much love, Nick

I’m hoping you say you do, as there are friendship goals.

Next Question

Can you talk a bit about Warren?

Next Question

Why do people take so long to understand the absence of love?","Dear Emma, Freddy and Paul,

 Warren officially joined the Bad Seeds when we were working on the Murder Ballads album in 1995. His influence was apparent from the start. Over the years I have developed a relationship with Warren that goes way beyond a professional collaboration and we are the best of friends – and yes, Emma, we hang out a lot. There is a certain sanctity in this friendship in that it has traversed all manner of troubles over the last twenty or so years, yet remains as resilient as ever. On a professional level we have developed a style of songwriting based almost exclusively on a kind of spiritual intuition and improvisation that feels, as Henry Miller prescribes, calm, joyful and reckless. In the songwriting sessions we sit and focus and grin and crash around in things. Warren is essentially an ideas machine (anyone who has worked in the studio with him will tell you the same) and it is an extraordinary privilege to be around him, both on stage and in the studio – and anywhere else, actually. When he is in full flight, he is unstoppable, and he is rarely not in full flight.

 There is a glass wall between us. We don’t discuss what we are doing.

 When we write songs together, we do so in a small studio near Brighton. I sit in one room with my piano and lyric books and microphone, and Warren sits in another room with his many instruments. There is a glass wall between us. We don’t discuss what we are doing, but simply start to play together. It is purely improvised. We make eye contact through the glass wall. This is essential. I can’t really define it but something happens; something that has to do with intuition and trust and jeopardy – the willingness to risk and, of course, to fail. We have what is called the ‘Walk of Shame’. This is when one of us reaches for an idea that, well, clearly sucks and we epically and embarrassingly fail. If we are not doing the ‘Walk of Shame’ fairly regularly, we are not doing our job as we are not reaching beyond what is comfortable.

 The concept of collaboration has always been the power source of the Bad Seeds. On some level these collaborations have an intensity to them that can step beyond the limits of friendship – sometimes a creative collaboration is defined by an honesty, a vulnerability and a brutal intensity that a normal friendship cannot contain. Sadly, a consequence of collaboration is that it can, on occasion, wear away at friendship, in the sense that we put so much of ourselves into the creative union that we simply forget to be friends.

 The current Bad Seeds may indeed be a testament to the corrosive capacity of collaboration. The Bad Seeds these days are on some level defined by a series of absences. It is difficult for some to see the Bad Seeds without also seeing the spirits of Blixa Bargeld, with his terrifying, tortured guitar or Mick Harvey, with his vast musical intelligence and his steely, censorious eyebrow. These extraordinarily intense musical collaborations found their natural ends but, even so, are still woven into the cloth of the band. Dear Conway and his ramshackle piano, Barry Adamson or Kid Congo Powers, or the limitless creative spirit of Anita Lane, are all strangely present within their absence.

 Absence, on the other hand, is a fertile ground where loss and love coalesce around memory to create ghosts that live among us. 

 Absence is not vacancy. Vacancy has no voice. Vacancy is empty and banal and atheistic. Absence, on the other hand, is a fertile ground where loss and love coalesce around memory to create ghosts that live among us. Absence is alive with energy. The Bad Seeds remain an entity that incorporates the spirits of the band’s past members, the residue of their enormous creative energies and their remembered voices. They are all on stage with us. In my view, no one has actually gone.

 In the end, I think Warren and I understand that the longevityof a collaboration depends to a certain extent on the conservation of friendship – friendships need care and constant maintenance – and so we exist as friends beyond the work as well. We go about our work – sometimes together, sometimes apart – and we wish each other happiness, and when one of us is in trouble, the other comes a-running, as the song goes.

I feel the process is like trying to describe something which I can only see imperfectly, or out of the corner of my eye. Did you ever experience that? Also, I hope you record Fireflies.","Dear S.,

 I very much like your description of the creative process – to see something imperfectly or out of the corner of your eye. This is exactly right. A good song idea never fronts up to you, never looks you in the eye, never announces itself – at least not in my experience. Lyric ideas are as illusive as fireflies. They are spirits flitting between the trees. The moment you give them your attention, they are gone.

 Lyric ideas are as illusive as fireflies. They are spirits flitting between the trees.

 But still you write, because over the years you have learned – midst the nonsensical hieroglyphics you compulsively scrawl in your notebooks, the dumb single lines that stare contemptuously back at you, the song titles that excite you then lose their magic the next time you look at them, the half-baked and derivative ideas, the stolen lines, the Freudian doodles, the desperate over-egged metaphors and lunatic, pencil-snapping, last-ditch attempts at something, my God, anything – you have learned to hold fast and trust. You have learned from hard-won experience that within this pile of words something mysterious is going on, something beyond the reaches of your understanding, something that simply takes its own sweet time and of which you are a tiny part – you are the guy who turns up to hold the pencil – and that suddenly, without warning, you find you have taken one line of no consequence and attached it to another line of no consequence and a kind of reverberation begins between the two lines, a throbbing – or as I like to call it, a ‘shimmering’ – it is something you can actually see! And as the two combined lines pulsate, they begin to collect significance impossibly, and at a rapid rate, to load up with meaning, even to call down a melody, and your heart begins to beat as if for the first time in God knows how long, and you come alive, you become an actual person, a functional, competent human being deserving of their place on this earth, because you know, suddenly, more than anything, that you are on to something and this shimmering convergence of words is setting off on its journey to change the world.

 As for Fireflies, we are still searching for it.

 Much love, Nick

 Dear All,

 I am loving reading your questions. They are wonderful things. As some are more like short novels, the questions are sometimes embedded deep in the letter. Very deep! I may need to edit and post just the actual question. I hope this is OK. Thank you all for your very thoughtful and considered questions.

Next Question

What is it that the seemingly recent connection to your fans is giving you to encourage you to hold these forum-style events?

Next Question

Do you really feel the love of your fans? And if you do, what does it bring you?","Dear Jenn,

 As I write this I am sitting in a studio with Warren in California working on the new record. It‘s a strange and wonderful thing and very different from what has gone before. We are under its spell. In the meantime I have been inundated with questions. The response to The Red Hand Files has caught me completely unawares, so thank you and everyone else very much.

 To answer your question – we have two family dogs. A gentle moony dog with sad eyes and cancer called Otis and a psychotic little dachshund called Nosferatu, whose one great enterprise in life is to bite me. I think it is safe to say that I love these dogs considerably more than they love me. They are devoted to my wife and guard her from me with their lives.

 Nature does feature more and more in my songs. Our natural environment has become a kind of crime scene as we tear away at it, and exploit it, and burn it, and melt it. This is of considerable concern to me as an inhabitant of this world, and I feel a certain amount of existential shame for being a part of the generation that bled it dry. It saddens me as I grow old to leave such a mess for our children to deal with.

 Having said that, the natural world in my songs is less about the destruction of the environment and more concerned with the biblical notion of paradise, within which I can set my human dramas of suffering and transcendence. My natural world is nature unspoilt, but with a kind of apocalyptic consciousness. The nature in my songs knows what’s ultimately coming. It is a world of metaphor, where nature becomes alive with the promise of God, where the moon is a mute witness and the stars hang in the air like questions.

 For me, the imagination is essentially religious as it reaches beyond truth toward meaning. And meaning itself is a kind of truth unburdened by proof. Science has its duty to truth, and so it should, but the songwriter and the poet move beyond what is known into the unknown world. They spend their time in a kind of dream world – a realm where God and his ghosts dwell, banished there by grim reason and rationality. This is our absurd and deluded dominion in all its feverish wonder. It is the enchanted forest. This is the world from where I draw my songs. If you are an artist, well, I’ll see you there, no doubt. If not, you can sail there on my songs!

 A final note on the dogs – my wife, Susie, is devoted to them and it would be fair to say she shows more understanding and empathy for the animal world than she does for the human world. Susie can look into the berserk eyes of Nosferatu and just melt him. She is a dog-whisper. She has the same effect on me. She is a husband-whisperer.

  

 Dear Leisa and Suzanne,

 The forum style events, which I will be doing more of next year, have to do with many things. First of all, the concerts have been expanding, which for the band and me is clearly very exciting. I feel the show which we are doing works on a large scale – in fact I enjoy doing it more as I still feel I have a very direct connection to my audience, but there is also a massive transcendent effect that is difficult to resist. However, I am very aware that the larger format can feel alienating to long-standing fans and I wanted to find a way of staying connected to them. This is partly the reason why I have decided to do the In Conversation events and also The Red Hand Files.

 Leisa, when you say ‘a seemingly recent connection’, this is both true and untrue. I have always felt connected to the audience. I feel though that these days there is a place that exists beneath the stratum of our actual lived selves – a river of light that can be accessed through the live performances. It is this river of light that flows through us all and binds us together.

 But there is another reason why I have decided to do the In Conversation events and The Red Hand Files, and that is a growing need for me to speak about certain things and not finding the appropriate places to do so. Some of the issues are difficult and require a bit of room, or space, or even nuance. I think there is much to speak about outside music as well as inside. I think people increasingly have a hunger to engage in alternative ideas about all manner of things and this is evidenced in the kind of questions that have been sent to me. I also receive a lot of mail these days from people in difficult situations and I feel that I have some experience which I can pass on.

 Finally, in response to the ‘do I feel the love?’ question – when I am on stage I feel a very deep connection with my audience that transcends anything I have felt previously. I experience people on a ‘soul’ level that for me is extremely powerful. When I look into the audience, I feel I can connect with each of them individually on an acutely personal level. I can see inside them. The more attentive I become, the stronger the feeling. To physically engage with the audience is important too – actual touching builds both a real and a metaphorical connection and it is an essential component to the live shows. I am stealing energy when I do that – as if the audience are a power source. Perhaps I am giving it out too. The circuit is complete.

 Without being hyperbolic, this feeling of collective love has saved my life. It is a transcendent circle that just seems to grow stronger. It is religious. A dear friend of mine, who is essentially an atheist and has no time for religious institutions, says she finds her spiritual transcendence at a Bad Seeds show. I believe her. I feel it too. It feels open and urgent and honest, and ultimately uplifting, moving us towards a sense of betterment and meaning. I arrive at this place, not by the music, but by the energy transmitted from the audience. I am awed.

 Much love, Nick

1,September 2018,https://www.theredhandfiles.com/writing-challenge-skeleton-tree,writing-challenge-skeleton-tree,1,Jakub,Łódź,Poland,"I would love to know how you feel about your writing now. Did it get easier after what seemed to be quite a challenge around “Skeleton Tree”? (I think I remember you saying in “One More Time with Feeling” that you kind of lost your grip on lyric writing for a while). Do you feel like you are changing now as a songwriter, perhaps in the light of the strong communion with fans? How is the process now?","Dear Jakub,

 The good news is that in the last year I have felt intensely connected to my writing. Something has definitely shifted and I have written a lot of new stuff. I can’t tell you what a relief this is. I am writing much more and it is strong and focused, in my opinion. But, you are right, for a year it had been difficult to work out how to write, because the centre had collapsed and Susie and I had been flung to the outer reaches of our lives. We were kind of outlanders floating in deep space.

 But what had collapsed? What is at the centre of our lives? In an artist’s case (and perhaps it is the same for everybody) I would say it is a sense of wonder. Creative people in general have an acute propensity for wonder. Great trauma can rob us of this, the ability to be awed by things. Everything loses its sheen and appears beyond our reach. We were surviving, but we were surviving in exile on the perimeter of our lives, way beyond anything that mattered.

 We all needed to draw ourselves back to a state of wonder. My way was to write myself there.

 So how do we return to our lives – to the awe of existence – and reclaim a sense of wonder? Well, for me, it had something to do with work but it also had something to do with community. Work and community. I kind of realised that work was the key to get back to my life, but I also realised that I was not alone in my grief and that many of you were, in one way or another, suffering your own sorrows, your own griefs. I felt this in our live performances. I felt very acutely that a sense of suffering was the connective tissue that held us all together. It was these two things – community and work – that showed Susie and me a way forward. Work became the lifelines thrown out to us as we floated lost in narcissism and self-absorption. It also became very clear to both of us that we were not alone! We could see there were many others out there, floating around in the dark, outside of their lives. It seemed to be everywhere we looked – people in search of meaning and wonder.

 We all needed to draw ourselves back to a state of wonder. My way was to write myself there. I sat and wrote and wrote, and in doing so I found a way back, or at least a way through the veil of grief, to the other side. I felt very strongly that the communal suffering, and our ability to transcend it, was the thing that held us together. This was not some pessimistic worldview, quite the opposite really. It became clear that as human beings we have enormous capabilities that allow us to rise above our suffering – that we are hardwired for transcendence. This was an acute realisation that changed the nature of our relationship to everything.

 To answer your question as to whether the lyric writing has changed, I would say that it has shifted fundamentally. I have found a way to write beyond the trauma, authentically, that deals with all manner of issues but does not turn its back on the issue of the death of my child. I found with some practise the imagination could propel itself beyond the personal into a state of wonder. In doing so the colour came back to things with a renewed intensity and the world seemed clear and bright and new. So I am very happy about this. It feels good to have a notebook full of words again.

 Here is a lyric, called Fireflies, which I wrote a few months ago that circles around this idea.

 Much love, Nick

  

 FIREFLIES

 Jesus lying in his mother’s arms
Is a photon released from a dying star
We move through the forest at night
The sky is full of exit wounds of light
Everything we need is just too far
We are fireflies a child has trapped in a jar
I am here and you are where you are
I am here and you are where you are

 We have lived a long time in the forest
We lie beneath the heaps of leaves
We are partial to this partial light
We cannot sleep and fear our dreams
There is no order here, nothing can be planned
We are fireflies trapped in a little boy’s hand
We are photons released from a dying star
I am here and you are where you are
I am here and you are where you are

 We lie among our atoms and I speak to you of things
And hope sometimes that maybe you will understand
There is no order here and there is no middle ground
Nothing can be predicted and nothing can be planned
We are fireflies pulsing dimly in the dark
We are here and you are where you are
We are here and you are where you are",https://www.theredhandfiles.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/red-hand-6.png,"AT EMILY DICKINSON'S HOUSE
